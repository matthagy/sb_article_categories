Election Results Analysis and Democratic Strategy\n\n   - Democrats missed landslide opportunities due to misjudging voter bases and reliance on Trump’s failures.\n   - Emphasis on the US Senate\'s structural biases favoring conservatives.\n   - Need for Democrats to embrace moderate candidates despite personal misgivings.\n\n6. Voter Demographics and Cultural Challenges\n\n   - Shift in demographic support, with unexpected gains for Trump among some non-white voters.\n   - Cultural identity issues, like the use of "Latinx," and how it reflects wider disconnection with certain voter bases.\n   - Democrats facing difficulty balancing progressive ideals with broader voter appeal.\n\n7.

Introduction\n\n   - The article addresses whimsical aspects of blog content and the importance of moderation in comments.\n   - It highlights how the author handles abuse in comments, emphasizing the need for a supportive environment for subscribers.\n\n2. Biden Administration Staffing Speculation\n\n   - Pre-election reporting on potential Biden Administration staffing.\n   - *Well-reported* Cabinet speculation stories often miss key factors.\n\n3. Important Factors in Cabinet Selection\n\n   - **Decision Process**: Final decisions rest with Joe Biden, involving consultations with Senate leaders.\n   - **Diverse Opinions**: Biden’s long career has led to a variety of allies with differing views.\n   - **Interdependencies**: Choices for Cabinet roles are interconnected, often influenced by diversity considerations.\n\n4. Symbolism of the Cabinet\n\n   - Cabinet symbolism should not be overly emphasized; actual decision-making power often lies elsewhere.\n   - *Obama administration* example: Policy influenced more by advisors than by agency heads.\n   - The President and White House staff significantly influence policy direction.\n\n5. Role and Importance of Cabinet Secretaries\n\n   - **Policy Making**: Primarily conducted within the White House, not directly by Cabinet secretaries.\n   - **Advisory Role**: Secretaries are advisors but do not control final decisions.\n   - **Senate Confirmation**: Influences who is appointed, as seen with Susan Rice under Obama.\n   - Internal dynamics and external considerations (e.g., diversity, ideology) affect appointments more than direct influence.\n\n6. Function of Cabinet Agencies\n\n   - Agencies often have different focuses than commonly assumed.\n   - Examples:\n     - HUD has limited influence on general housing policy but impacts specific public housing rules.\n     - Commerce Department's budget heavily tied to Census preparation, not strictly economic policy.\n\n7. Influence of the White House Staff\n\n   - White House staff roles can overshadow Cabinet positions.\n   - Positions like Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor, and OMB Director hold significant power.\n   - Influence depends more on the President's trust and willingness to heed advice than on formal titles.\n\n8. White House Staff Roles\n\n   - *National Economic Council, Council of Economic Advisors,* and *Domestic Policy Council* have varying responsibilities.\n   - Position titles do not necessarily indicate the scope of influence.\n\n9. Independent Commissions\n\n   - Importance of bipartisan commissions which can act independently.\n   - Commissions like SEC and FTC have significant regulatory roles and operate partly outside direct White House control.\n\n10. Conclusion and Future Speculation\n\n    - Potential Cabinet under a Democratic Senate: Diverse and qualified appointees with some ideological balance.\n    - Impact of Georgia Senate races on Biden's ability to confirm Cabinet picks.\n    - Influence of Senate composition on the stability of the administration's functions and appointment capabilities."},{id:0x11a5790,title:"Low interest rates are a curse — we need massive fiscal imprudence",subtitle:"Only madness can bring back sanity",date:"2020-11-24",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/low-interest-rates-are-a-curse-we",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2661,comment_count:107,likes:56,category:"Navigating Fiscal Policy and Debt Challenges",summary:"1. Introduction\n\n   - The article examines the dominance of culture wars in politics, attributing this to economic factors like low interest rates.\n   - It highlights the benefits of independent economic thought separate from viral tech platform demands.\n\n2. Low Interest Rates and Politics\n\n   - **Historical Context**: In the mid-1980s to early 1990s, high interest rates pressured the federal budget, necessitating debt reduction.\n   - *Current Situation*: Today's low rates mean deficit debates involve no immediate tangible consequences.\n\n3. Connection Between Interest Rates and Political Dynamics\n\n   - Low interest rates reduce tension between tax cuts and government spending.\n   - **Shared Support**: Policies popular with both the left and right sustain due to a lack of budget constraints.\n\n4. Republican and Democratic Fiscal Strategies\n\n   - A coalition between business interests and cultural conservatives works only without fiscal trade-offs.\n   - **Obama’s Strategy**: Efforts for bipartisan deficit reduction aimed to constrain Republicans, but had mixed results.\n\n5. Secular Stagnation and Economic Theories\n\n   - *Global Savings Glut*: Caused by increased savings from the wealthy, post-crisis foreign currency reserves, and sovereign wealth funds.\n   - **Decrease in Demand for Capital**: Slowed population growth reduces demand for housing and infrastructure.\n\n6. Impacts of Low Interest Rates\n\n   - Empowerment of right populism and far-left utopianism.\n   - Lack of incentives for cost-benefit analysis or spending prioritizations.\n\n7. Pathway to Healthier Political Economy\n\n   - Move away from low-interest rate dynamics for more disciplined fiscal practices.\n     - **Rural Support**: Consider adjusting subsidies or increasing taxes for federal funding.\n     - **Program Efficiency**: Propose better or more efficient government programs.\n\n8. Proposed Solutions\n\n   - **Population Growth**: Increase legal immigration and deregulate land use.\n   - Tax incentives for physical capital investments and programs encouraging childcare and housing.\n   - Possible deals offer targeted tax cuts and spending programs as a pathway.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\n   - Emphasizing population growth and capital demand might help adjust interest rates.\n   - A balanced approach to fiscal policy could stabilize politics without the prevalence of low rates."},{id:0x11b9b1c,title:"Make Blue America Great Again",subtitle:"We need more ambition in the parts of the country where progressives can win",date:"2020-11-16",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/make-blue-america-great-again",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2654,comment_count:330,likes:178,category:"Complex Interplay of Politics and Policy",summary:'1.

Leveraging Blue States for Progressive Success\n\n   - **Ambitious Policy Implementation**: Use blue states as testing grounds.\n     - Example: Successes in Massachusetts with marriage equality and healthcare.\n   - Vision for Progressives:\n     - Create appealing progressive governance that can be a model nationwide.\n\n4. Areas for Progressive Action\n\n   - Potential policy areas for state-level implementation:\n     - Ambitious public health options and **free community college**.\n     - **Green New Deal** initiatives focused on state infrastructure.\n     - Preschool, childcare, and poverty reduction strategies.\n     - State wage boards and sectoral bargaining.\n\n5. Challenges in Blue States\n\n   - Public perception: Blue states often seen as offering cultural amenities over high-quality public services.\n   - Cost of living disparities driven by housing regulations.\n\n6. Housing Policy Reform\n\n   - Importance of market-rate housing to ensure accessibility and tax base growth.\n   - Housing reforms as critical to making blue states affordable and desirable.\n\n7. Learning from History: "Sewer Socialism"\n\n   - **Historical Reference**: Milwaukee’s socialist governance focused on public works.\n   - Lesson: Practical governance and effective public services make progressive ideas tangible.\n\n8. Infrastructure and Efficiency\n\n   - Example from Boston: Transit Matters proposal for efficient commuter rail improvements.\n   - Organizational reforms in transport could serve wider regions such as Boston.\n\n9. Balancing Ambition with Practicality\n\n   - Efficient public sector management doesn’t equate to reducing public sector size.\n   - **Ambition Needed**: More proactive policy-making in blue states.\n\n10. Conclusion: Path Forward\n\n   - Encouragement for progressive leaders to aim high in state governance.\n   - Media\'s role in shaping political success through state-level accomplishments.\n   - Call to action for readers and leaders to drive ambitious policies in blue states.'},{id:0x11c76f8,title:"Minimum wage wins, affirmative action loses",subtitle:"A tale of two ballot initiatives",date:"2020-11-17",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/minimum-wage-wins-affirmative-action",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1963,comment_count:228,likes:141,category:"Complex Interplay of Politics and Policy",summary:"1. Introduction\n\n   - The article discusses two progressive ballot initiatives: one in Florida that passed and one in California that failed.\n   - Focus is on political lessons learned from these initiatives.\n\n2. Florida's Minimum Wage Increase\n\n   - Florida approved a referendum to raise the minimum wage to $15/hour, with over 60% voter support.\n     - Indicates bipartisan appeal of minimum wage issues.\n   - Research shows that increasing minimum wage disproportionately benefits Black and Latino households.\n\n3. California's Proposition 16\n\n   - Proposition 16 aimed to re-legalize affirmative action in college admissions and state contracting but was defeated.\n   - Despite Democratic Party support, the initiative didn't resonate with voters.\n   - Highlights a discrepancy between progressive advocacy for affirmative action and public opinion.\n\n4. Political Lessons\n\n   - **Raising minimum wage** is more popular than the generic Democratic Party brand.\n     - Economic policies can advance racial equity.\n   - Lack of emphasis on minimum wage issues in Democratic campaigns is noted.\n     - Joe Biden's campaign did not prioritize this issue, despite its popularity.\n\n5. The Role of Race and Economics in Progressive Politics\n\n   - Economic measures like minimum wage increases and Medicaid expansion are effective in closing racial gaps.\n   - Historically, liberal policymakers advanced universal policies benefiting minorities without emphasizing racial angles.\n   - Recent trends emphasize racial angles in policy advocacy, which can be counterproductive politically.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\n   - The need for a strategic focus on universal economic policies to address both class and racial disparities.\n   - Encouragement for Democrats to emphasize popular economic policies to build broader coalitions for future elections.\n- Emphasizing racial aspects in economic policy advocacy might not always be effective, especially among wider electorates."},{id:0x11e50b5,title:"What's wrong with the media ",subtitle:"The young/urban/educated bubble in an era of growing polarization",date:"2020-11-19",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/whats-wrong-with-the-media",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2697,comment_count:308,likes:164,category:"Competition, Media, and Future Risks",summary:"1. **Introduction to Media Trends**\n   \n   - Recent policy reports address diverse topics like maternal mortality and student loan forgiveness.\n   - The author reflects on personal experiences and broad media trends.\n   - Emphasis on reclaiming an independent, blog-like status.\n\n2. **Predominant Media Demographics**\n\n   - Characteristics of media workforce:\n     - Young, urban, and educated.\n     - Predominantly graduates from selective colleges.\n     - Concentrated in major coastal cities, especially New York.\n   - Impact of digital disruption:\n     - Reducing significance of regional newspapers.\n     - Dominance by youth-heavy, digital-native startups.\n\n3. **Political Polarization and Media**\n\n   - Changes in national politics:\n     - Polarization around age, education, and urbanization.\n   - Ideological shifts:\n     - Media's demographic skew amplifies left-leaning ideology unwittingly.\n   - Instability in the media due to economic trends and ideological shifts.\n\n4. **Internal Dynamics in Media Organizations**\n\n   - Example from The New York Times:\n     - Digital transformation has empowered non-editorial staff to critique content.\n     - Increased ideological influence from digitally oriented staff.\n   - Professional political journalists:\n     - Struggle to balance audience expectations and ideological pressures.\n\n5. **Examples of Ideological Influence**\n\n   - Instances of far-left perspectives in non-political media:\n     - Gaming and entertainment reviews incorporating political commentary.\n   - Bad analysis slipping through unnoticed due to ideological alignment.\n\n6. **Media Industry's Economic Challenges**\n\n   - Internet's impact on traditional journalism roles:\n     - Newspapers' traditional ad revenue diverted to digital platforms.\n   - Potential for startup disruption exists but remains unfulfilled.\n\n7. **The New York Times Phenomenon**\n\n   - Dominance in digital subscription market:\n     - Benefits from Trump-era political dynamics.\n   - Success attributed to effective hiring and diversification.\n   - Poaching talent across the industry solidifies its standing.\n\n8. **Challenges for Disruptors and Industry Dynamics**\n\n   - Potential disruptors face precarious conditions.\n   - Growth concentrated at established giants like The New York Times.\n   - Ideological uniformity leads to groupthink and instability.\n\n9. **Reflection on Political Journalism's Evolution**\n\n   - Old pathologies of partisan balance and sourcing biases persist.\n   - Lack of demographic diversity adds to ideological monotony.\n\n10. **Conclusion and Personal Position**\n\n    - Advocacy for independent media ventures:\n      - Importance of maintaining a distinct voice outside mainstream giants.\n    - Encouragement for readership support and subscription growth.\n    - Recognition of the challenges in achieving massive disruption in digital media."},{id:0x1219d94,title:"Some optimism about America's Covid response",subtitle:"A social cohesion disaster but an innovation success story",date:"2020-11-20",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/some-optimism-about-americas-covid",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1850,comment_count:143,likes:77,category:"Challenges and Innovations in Global Vaccination",summary:"1.

Introduction to Racial Wealth Gap Discussion\n\n   - **Unfashionable leftist view**: Discussion on racial wealth gap often overlooks the broader issue of wealth concentration among a small, disproportionately white elite.\n   - Proposed solutions:\n     1. Diversify the wealthiest elite—focus on racial diversity within the rich.\n     2. Narrow the gap between rich and non-rich—benefits all races and is more politically advantageous.\n\n2. Analysis of Wealth Distribution\n\n   - **Kevin Carney’s thesis**: Removing the top wealthy white quartile, Black and white wealth dynamics align.\n   - Subprime mortgage impact:\n     - Affected both Black and white households.\n     - Racial wealth gap increased because rich white people’s wealth is largely in stocks.\n   - **Matt Bruenig’s insights**:\n     - Racial composition of the wealthy elite according to **Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances**:\n       - Top 10% by wealth: 2.2% Black.\n       - Top 5%: 2% Black.\n       - Top 1%: 0.5% Black.\n     - Sample size concerns when analyzing top wealthiest individuals.\n\n3. Income and Wage Disparity\n\n   - Wage inequality increase from 1979 to 2016:\n     - Black/white economic gap widened.\n   - Potential solutions:\n     - Create more equitable wage structures.\n     - Diversify high-earner demographics without increasing average pay.\n\n4. Billionaires and Representation\n\n   - **Forbes 400 list** observations:\n     - Seven Black billionaires with combined wealth of $13 billion.\n     - Comparison to individual white billionaires of similar worth.\n     - Black people own less than 1% of $3.2 trillion held by top 400 billionaires.\n   - Implication: Wealth concentration among few doesn't benefit typical white individuals either.\n\n5. Misguided Approaches to Economic Equity\n\n   - Example from **Hingham, MA**:\n     - Effort to increase racial diversity by marketing to wealthy Black families.\n     - Suggested alternative: Increase housing near transit for broader access and diversity.\n   - Parallel: Diversifying billionaires vs. addressing the wealth gap for majority populations.\n\n6.

Introduction\n\n   - The article highlights a shift in the Republican Party toward dangerous authoritarianism, particularly in the post-election behavior of Donald Trump and his supporters.\n   - Reflects on past major Republican policy issues, like same-sex marriage and Social Security privatization, and contrasts them with today's political landscape.\n   \n2. The Changing GOP Dynamics\n\n   - Republicans have become more unhinged and conspiratorial, with unethical and dishonest tendencies exacerbated by newer GOP caucus members.\n   - Chris Hayes’ tweets point out the lack of a cohesive GOP policy agenda, suggesting intellectual bankruptcy within the party.\n   - Despite past ambitions, Republicans have largely stagnated on advancing proactive policies.\n     - For example, attempts to privatize Social Security and Medicare have fizzled out.\n     - On reproductive rights, they've shifted focus from marriage equality to transgender issues.\n   \n3. Policy Abandonment and Moderation\n   \n   - There is evidence of unhinged moderation within the GOP:\n     - A bipartisan energy bill suggests a shift toward moderate policy despite Trump's climate denial.\n     - The failure to repeal Obamacare and reduced hostility toward major social programs mark a scaling back of previous ambitions.\n   - Despite Trump's work with administrative burdens, the broader GOP agenda on working-class issues appears diluted.\n   \n4. Immigration and Social Issues\n   \n   - Republicans maintain a hard stance on immigration, a longstanding area of conservative unity.\n   - Both parties have become more polarized on key issues, but social conservative agendas have not moved further right since the early 2000s.\n   \n5. Current and Future Implications\n\n   - Republican support for Trump’s election fraud claims raises concerns about future electoral integrity.\n   - With polarized divides in education and trust, conspiratorial and high-minded concerns are sorted into party lines.\n   - Potential 2024 implications include:\n     - A GOP win through Electoral College discrepancies rather than policy shifts.\n     - Vulnerable Democratic seats that could flip in a tightly contested election.\n\n6. Democratic and Republican Paradox\n\n   - While the GOP benefits from institutional advantages, its base displays insurrectionary behavior more befitting of an opposition party.\n   - Contradictory positioning where Republicans are advantaged by system biases yet behave anti-institutionally.\n   \n7. Conclusion\n\n   - The GOP's retreat from prior economic policy platforms presents a political strategy.\n   - If Republicans pursue policy as discussed—less economic reform, more cultural wars—this could reshape American politics.\n   - Recognizing both the cultural shift and policy retreat provides a comprehensive understanding of the GOP's current trajectory."},{id:0x1270826,title:"Janet Yellen's mistake ",subtitle:"A look back at the 2015 interest rate increase",date:"2020-11-23",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/janet-yellens-mistake",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2885,comment_count:124,likes:77,category:"Economic Policies and Partisan Divides",summary:"1. **Introduction**\n\n   - Overview of personal holiday plans and writing schedule.\n   - Focus on Janet Yellen and her potential nomination as Secretary of Treasury.\n\n2. **Janet Yellen’s Credentials and Career**\n\n   - Yellen's accomplishments:\n     - Second woman to chair the Council of Economic Advisors.\n     - First woman to chair the Federal Reserve.\n   - Potential as the first female Treasury Secretary.\n   - Broad support from both progressives and centrists within the Democratic Party.\n\n3. **Critique of Yellen’s Fed Chair Tenure**\n\n   - Mistake during Yellen’s tenure at the Federal Reserve:\n     - 2015 interest rate increase despite economic slowdown.\n   - Analysis by Skanda Amarnath highlighting Yellen's mixed track record.\n\n4. **Federal Reserve’s Role and Economic Policies**\n\n   - The Fed’s primary function: manipulating the federal funds rate.\n   - Historical context under Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, and Ben Bernanke.\n   - **Key problem**: Unemployment high despite zero federal funds rate.\n\n5. **Unemployment and Economic Trends During Yellen-Obama Era**\n\n   - Slow yet steady decline in unemployment.\n   - The decision to raise interest rates in late 2015.\n   - Context: Low inflation rates at the time.\n\n6. **Debate on Full Employment and Labor Force Participation**\n\n   - Disagreement on labor force participation rates during Obama’s second term.\n   - Various explanations: \n     - *Redistribution Recession* hypothesis.\n     - Skills gap theory.\n   - Obama's economic team focused on aging population and structural reforms.\n  \n7. **Demand-Side Economics and Wage Growth**\n\n   - Argument for keeping interest rates low to spur wage growth and job participation.\n   - Yellen's skepticism towards this argument, emphasizing productivity concerns.\n\n8. **Economic Outcomes Under Trump**\n\n   - Acceleration of wage growth during Trump’s tenure.\n   - Similar economic growth patterns as the Obama era but with significant wage increases.\n   - Persistent low participation rates debunking theories unrelated to *demand-side issues*.\n\n9. **Yellen's Rate Hike: Impact and Significance**\n\n   - The 2016 rate hike was minor but consequential for policymaking discussions.\n   - Importance of accurate assessments of labor market conditions for Biden’s administration.\n\n10. **Political Dynamics and Treasury Selection**\n\n    - Influence of Larry Summers in Democratic economic circles.\n    - Debate around Lael Brainard and other candidates:\n      - Brainard’s dissent on the interest rate hike and alignment with Summers.\n      - Yellen emerged as a compromise candidate.\n\n11. **Conclusion and Recommendations**\n\n    - Emphasizing the need for improved judgment on full employment policies.\n    - Avoid reducing economic policy disputes to single ideological axes.\n    - Strategy recommendation: Retain Brainard on the Fed board to maintain stability.\n\n12. **Final Thoughts**\n\n    - Importance of understanding nuanced differences among potential candidates for steering fiscal policies appropriately.\n    - Recognition that past mistakes should inform future economic strategies, particularly on employment and fiscal stimulus policies."},{id:0x12bae63,title:"National Democrats' misguided re-embrace of gun control",subtitle:"It costs votes and doesn't produce any gun control",date:"2020-11-25",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/national-democrats-misguided-re-embrace",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:3174,comment_count:404,likes:147,category:"Complex Intersections in Policy and Health",summary:"1. **Historical Context and Democratic Strategy**\n\n   - Post-2004 to Obama era:\n     - Democrats largely moved away from gun control to avoid losing votes.\n     - Factors influencing this decision included:\n       1.

Introduction\n\n   - The article discusses the controversy around the idea of \"defunding the police.\"\n   - Defunding is seen not as a failed slogan but as a significant aspect of the police reform debate.\n\n2. Background and Context\n\n   - *Defund the police* gained traction after George Floyd's death.\n     - Aimed at reallocating police funds to other community resources.\n     - Kept police funding cuts central to the reform conversation.\n   - Barack Obama criticized the idea as a tactical error.\n     - Argues it alienates broader audiences who might support change.\n\n3. Critique of Defunding Strategy\n\n   - Defunding lacks focus on accountability and effectiveness:\n     - Many police departments have issues with accountability.\n     - Decreasing budgets doesn't inherently solve these issues.\n   - The approach shifts focus from measures like those in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.\n\n4. Misalignment with Desired Outcomes\n\n   - Inspecting police effectiveness:\n     - Police are often ineffective at solving crimes due to resource constraints.\n     - Studies show increased funding for policing can reduce crime rates and enhance detective work.\n   - Existing police misconduct issues require different solutions:\n     - Structural changes in accountability and firing processes are necessary.\n\n5. Alternative Reform Strategies\n\n   - Successful reform examples include Richmond, CA, and Camden, NJ:\n     - Reinforce the idea that more trained officers, not fewer, are needed.\n   - Emphasizes restructuring police roles rather than abolishing them.\n\n6. Misunderstandings of Defunding\n\n   - *Defund the police* concept often misinterpreted:\n     - Some suggest non-police solutions for tasks like mental health crises.\n     - However, this would not have prevented a case like George Floyd’s.\n   - Funding and welfare state:\n     - Advocating for a welfare state involves higher taxes, unrelated to police budgets.\n\n7. Broader Political Implications\n\n   - Political landscape:\n     - Democrats have pushed for federal aid to local governments.\n     - Evidence suggests that federal support for policing can be beneficial.\n   - Challenges from police unions:\n     - Reform requires addressing union agreements and changing state laws.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\n   - The article stresses the need for high-quality, accountable policing:\n     - Argues against the sole focus on defunding.\n     - Highlights the importance of operational and structural reforms to prevent misconduct.\n   - Defunding may inadvertently lead to negative consequences like increased crime and resistance to reform concepts."},{id:0x14800ed,title:"The case for canceling a lot of student debt",subtitle:"There's a good plan here",date:"2020-12-04",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-case-for-canceling-a-lot-of-student",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1795,comment_count:312,likes:63,category:"Navigating Fiscal Policy and Debt Challenges",summary:"1.

Debt Relief Debate\n\n   - Backed by figures like Chuck Schumer, the idea of using executive power for student loan forgiveness has gained traction.\n   - There is resistance within *wonkish circles*, viewing it as regressive and ineffective.\n   - The article contends these critiques are overstated and lack proper engagement with the actual policy discourse.\n\n3. Issues with Indiscriminate Loan Forgiveness\n\n   - **Three Key Points**:\n     - Indiscriminate forgiveness would be a mistake, as not all borrowers need it equally.\n     - *Acknowledgment that Biden's advisers understand the challenges*.\n     - Arguments against loan forgiveness often address a straw man scenario.\n   - The debate should differentiate between undergraduate loans and loans for professional schools like medicine or law.\n\n4. Practical and Ethical Considerations\n\n   - Forgiving all debt might disproportionately benefit high-income *professionals* like doctors and lawyers.\n   - The policy should target middle-class individuals more effectively by capping forgiveness limits or excluding high earners.\n\n5. Constraints and Opportunities\n\n   - Despite issues, student loan relief is something Biden can realistically achieve.\n   - *Cash benchmarking*: While giving direct cash might be preferable, current legal frameworks don't allow for it.\n   - Low interest rates and other economic conditions make debt relief a feasible tool amidst political constraints.\n\n6. Political and Economic Implications\n\n   - *Moderate popularity* of student loan forgiveness exists, especially when tailored to exclude high-income earners.\n   - Comparison made to Trump’s agricultural subsidies, suggesting that targeted relief does not provoke significant public backlash.\n   - Even if not politically transformative, debt relief can be part of a series of beneficial executive actions.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\n   - The author believes Biden should pursue student loan relief as a practical step to improve lives within current political limits.\n   - Debt relief offers a *manageable risk* with potential to bolster the economy and satisfy parts of Biden’s political base without substantial downsides."},{id:0x14c5f24,title:"Joe Rogan and the doomed politics of shunning",subtitle:"It's good to go on popular shows and talk to people",date:"2020-12-15",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/joe-rogan-and-the-doomed-politics",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2204,comment_count:398,likes:157,category:"Strategies and Challenges in Modern Politics",summary:"1.

Fiscal Conditions in NYC and the Case for UBI\n\n   - NYC\'s pandemic-induced budget crisis provides a rationale for rethinking fiscal strategies.\n   - The city collects higher per-person taxes than other big cities without superior public services.\n   - Alternative approach: maintain high tax revenues, reduce inefficient spending, and return surplus as a mini-UBI.\n\n3. Local Government Dynamics\n\n   - Local governments are financially constrained and need to compete for tax bases.\n   - Different from big cities, suburban areas use Tiebout Competition for optimal taxes/services.\n   - Major cities, like NYC, benefit from commuters and maintain higher taxes, spent on welfare and public jobs.\n\n4. Business Model for Cities\n\n   - Pre-pandemic, NYC\'s demand for residency was high despite population decline, indicating a thriving "business model."\n   - Fiscally Standardized Cities data show NYC with high tax revenue pre-pandemic, primarily affected by state aid systems.\n\n5. Pandemic Effects and Economic Outlook\n\n   - COVID-19 has caused a budget deficit, potentially reducing demand for office space and housing.\n   - A potential positive outcome: more affordable NYC, similar to "poor but sexy" Berlin, fostering cultural growth.\n\n6. Challenges and Opportunities in City Budget Management\n\n   - NYC’s spending on public sector wages and benefits is high relative to other cities.\n   - In fiscal crises, voters might have to choose between austerity and fiscal responsibility.\n   - Future revenue growth could fund a UBI, raising fiscal questions about spending priorities.\n\n7. Feasibility of UBI Implementation in NYC\n\n   - Census data suggests that $58 billion per year is untenable for a full UBI model.\n   - Reducing city spending to average levels could free significant funds, but not enough for full UBI.\n   - Constructing a sustainable fiscal policy could include efficiency and surplus generation.\n\n8. Urban Policy Reform and UBI City Concept\n\n   - Urban policy should consider more efficient management of transit systems and labor.\n   - Rezoning and regulatory review could increase housing construction and tax revenues.\n   - A UBI model incentivizes reduced fiscal bloat in exchange for direct citizen payouts.\n\n9. Broader Implications and Conclusions\n\n   - NYC’s fiscal model, if successful, could encourage other cities like San Francisco to adopt similar strategies.\n   - Cities not as resource-rich may struggle with unique issues, needing different solutions.\n   - While UBI isn’t the sole solution, it presents an innovative framework for urban governance reform.'},{id:0x1c7bafd,title:"Culturally relevant pedagogy is good",subtitle:"Score one for Team Woke",date:"2020-12-31",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/pedagogy",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2243,comment_count:342,likes:201,category:"Evolving Dynamics in U.S. K-12 Education",summary:'1.

The Rationale for Culturally Relevant Pedagogy\n\n   - Anecdotal support from educators suggests engagement increases when students see themselves in their studies.\n   - Evidence supports incorporating ethnic studies and culturally relevant content to improve learning outcomes.\n   - Debate exists regarding the enduring value of teaching classical works versus culturally relevant materials.\n\n4. Counterarguments and Critiques\n\n   - Some argue classical education represents universal human experiences that remain relevant for all.\n     - Examples mentioned: Frederick Douglass and Thomas Chatterton Williams advocate for diverse literature.\n   - Skeptics argue against politicized "woke" jargon and emphasize utility over ideology in pedagogy changes.\n\n5. Evidence in Support of Culturally Relevant Instruction\n\n   - Findings show positive outcomes from ethnic studies and culturally tuned programs in school systems.\n     - Tucson’s Mexican-American Studies program showed improved test scores and graduation rates.\n     - Studies demonstrate benefits of culturally tailored math lessons in Alaska Native education.\n   - Critics urge proponents of diverse curricula to maintain rigorous evidence-based approach.\n\n6.

Economic Implications of Immigration Policies\n\n   - Immigration restrictions may affect specific sectors differently.\n     - *Example:* Arizona saw wage increases after cracking down on undocumented workers.\n   - Moving between sectors can lead to economic adjustments without improving overall incomes.\n\n4. Macroeconomic Policies vs. Immigration\n\n   - The author argues that achieving full employment is a matter of *macroeconomic policy* rather than immigration constraints.\n   - Donald Trump’s policies led to wage growth due to fiscal stimulus, not immigration control.\n     - Policies included tax cuts, increased spending, and pressure for low interest rates.\n\n5. Sector-Specific Outcomes from Immigration\n\n   - Studies reveal nuanced effects of immigration:\n     - Puerto Ricans in Orlando boosted certain sector wages despite initial expectations from Cass's view.\n   - *Key Point:* Maximizing overall prosperity may not align with sector-specific wage goals.\n\n6. Additional Considerations\n\n   - Significant considerations for reducing immigrant worker flows include:\n     - Limiting labor opportunities can artificially increase sector wages but raise broader costs.\n     - Potential consequences of limiting immigrant labor include inflation and negative terms of trade.\n\n7. Policy Recommendations\n\n   - The focus should be on macroeconomic measures to ensure full employment, not restricting immigration as a solution.\n   - Suggestions include:\n     - Providing legal pathways for immigrants\n     - Legal status for existing undocumented population\n   - Realistic objectives include addressing fiscal impacts and social concerns, not using immigration policy to influence labor markets.\n\n8.

The Lawyerly Instincts and Its Flaws\n\n   - Many policymakers add layers of processes to combat low trust.\n     - Example: Cuomo\'s complex vaccine prioritization backfires by slowing administration.\n     - The principle of more control leading to more problems ("tightening your grip") is demonstrated.\n\n3. The "Does Exactly What It Says on the Tin" Principle\n\n   - Policymakers should implement policies that are:\n     - *Understandable*: Clear on what they intend to do.\n     - *Transparent*: Easy to verify execution.\n     - *Achievable*: Realistic and practical goals.\n   - This approach fosters conditional trust by doing exactly what’s promised.\n     - May entail waste and efficiency loss but establishes reliability.\n\n4.

Introduction\n\n   - The article argues that the slogan *Defunding the police* is ineffective and that the real issue needing attention is police misconduct.\n   - Emphasizes that reducing police budgets won't solve misconduct problems but might instead require increasing resources to enforce accountability.\n\n2. The Problem with Police Misconduct\n\n   - Police misconduct involves both excessive force and a broader range of poor conduct that is quietly tolerated.\n   - **Key issues include:**\n     - Difficulty in firing and penalizing officers for misconduct.\n     - Pension structures and job security incentives that discourage accountability.\n   - Examples of police misconduct resulting in severe consequences for communities.\n\n3. Challenges in Firing Bad Officers\n\n   - Police chiefs face obstacles like civil service commissions that often reverse disciplinary actions.\n   - **Police Officers’ Bill of Rights** in some states complicates misconduct investigations.\n   - Arbitrators often overturn firings, hampering efforts to address misconduct.\n\n4. Importance of Addressing Systemic Issues\n\n   - Misconduct often concentrated among a small percentage of officers. \n   - **Existing systemic issues include:**\n     - Strong union protections for police officers similar to other public sector jobs.\n   - Urgency in identifying repeat offenders and removing them from the force.\n\n5. Proposal for Effective Reform\n\n   - **Reform suggestions:**\n     - Remove special procedural rights for police officers in misconduct investigations.\n     - Change compensation structures to attract more candidates while easing the dismissal of underperforming officers.\n     - Enhance recruiting efforts for a more diverse police force.\n     - Ensure officers dismissed for misconduct cannot easily re-enter the system.\n\n6. The Impact of Diversity in Policing\n\n   - Studies show that a diverse police force may lead to fewer aggressive incidents and better community relations.\n   - Hiring more officers from marginalized groups like Black and Hispanic communities, and increasing female representation can positively affect police behavior.\n\n7. Comprehensive Reform Strategy\n\n   - Hiring more officers and detectives to reduce overtime and fatigue-related issues.\n   - Focus on community presence and interaction rather than aggressive tactics like stop-and-frisk.\n   - High standard of conduct should be implemented to improve trust and efficacy without compromising officer safety.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\n   - Asserts the need for a large, well-compensated, and diverse police force to uphold high standards and adequately address both crime and misconduct.\n   - Emphasizes that while the solution may be costly, addressing police misconduct is crucial and requires a nuanced, comprehensive approach."},{id:0x1e57448,title:"You can't blame bad leaders for everything",subtitle:"The public is troublingly tolerant of bad Covid response",date:"2021-01-26",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/you-cant-blame-bad-leaders-for-everything",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:3756,comment_count:390,likes:146,category:"Challenges and Opportunities in Urban Transit and Development",summary:"1. **Concept of Tech-Positivity vs. Techno-Optimism**\n\n   - *Tech-positivity* is about embracing technological progress as beneficial, distinct from supporting large tech companies.\n   - There's skepticism about the future use of transformative technologies due to public aversion to change.\n\n2. **Public Reaction to Covid-19 Response**\n\n   - There's significant public tolerance for ineffective Covid responses in both the US and Europe.\n   - Despite poor non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccine rollouts, electorates show limited frustration.\n     - *Example*: A poll showed support for wasting vaccine doses to prevent line-cutting, indicating complacency.\n\n3. **Vaccine Approval Challenges**\n\n   - The AstraZeneca vaccine, though considered safe, faces delays in the US due to regulatory caution.\n   - There's little public pressure for speeding up vaccine approvals, highlighting a broader acceptance of the status quo.\n\n4. **Potential of Regional Rail Networks**\n\n   - Enhancing the DC-Baltimore commuter rail could boost regional economies.\n     - Adopting **German S-Bahn model** is suggested for better connections and service.\n   - Despite existing plans and potential benefits, political and practical challenges impede progress.\n\n5. **Political Dynamics and Public Sentiment**\n\n   - Public preference for stability over bold change impacts political decisions.\n     - Moderate governors are often favored for their balancing act rather than transformative agendas.\n   - Bernie Sanders argues for bold Democratic actions, but historical patterns show overreach can lead to backlash.\n\n6. **Conclusion: Need for Change and Progress**\n\n   - The future requires adopting *good policy ideas* that are currently unpopular.\n   - Emphasizing the value of change and progress is crucial to overcoming voter complacency and promoting innovation."},{id:0x1e6433c,title:"The “induced demand“ case against YIMBYism is wrong",subtitle:"An empirically false, wildly illogical objection to housing abundance",date:"2021-01-27",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/induced-demand",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2767,comment_count:265,likes:172,category:"Zoning Reforms and Housing Scarcity",summary:"1.

Key Observations About Gentrification\n\n   - Common belief: Removal of new developments blocks gentrification.\n   - Illustrative *example*: A D.C. neighborhood used as a model for resisting gentrification.\n\n4. Counterarguments to Induced Demand Theory\n\n   - Induced demand theory is largely empirically false.\n   - Accepting such logic could hinder all quality-of-life improvements.\n   - Even if true, it doesn't inherently make new constructions bad.\n   - Misunderstands the YIMBY proposition.\n\n5.

Historical Context and Change\n\n   - In the 1990s, slang such as “gay” was commonly used as an insult, reflecting societal norms.\n     - Some communities, like those at Grace Church School in Greenwich Village, actively discouraged this usage.\n   - Social norms evolve, and debates arise over what is considered *racist* or *inappropriate*.\n\n3. Kendi\'s Perspective on Racism\n\n   - Ibram Kendi’s book "How To Be An Antiracist" seeks to redefine racism.\n   - Core ideas:\n     - Inequalities between racial groups are by definition *racist*.\n     - Not supporting measures to close these gaps is also racist.\n     - Criticism of the *academic achievement gap* as a racist construct.\n\n4. Counterarguments to Kendi\n\n   - *Academic achievement* cannot be solely attributed to intelligence.\n     - Example: Education outcomes impacted by socioeconomic factors.\n   - Research on school performance shows it is affected by factors like:\n     - **Food insecurity**\n     - **School shootings**\n     - **Racist teachers**\n     - **Housing instability**\n\n5.

Filibuster reform is supported by not just leftists but also experienced senators like Harry Reid.\n   - Moderate Democrats incorrectly assume that preserving the filibuster leads to bipartisan compromises.\n   - Removing the filibuster can lead to more effective bipartisan legislation.\n\n6. **Current Challenges and Political Strategy**\n\n   - Moderate Democrats, like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, are perceived as defending a newer practice.\n   - Senators express frustration with leadership-driven legislation and desire for individual input in the process.\n   - The filibuster encourages obstruction instead of fostering compromise.\n\n7. **Opportunities if the Filibuster is Reformed**\n\n   -

Introduction to the Overton Window\n\n   - Originally developed by Joseph Overton, the concept describes a "window of political possibility."\n   - The authentic version emphasizes *persuasive advocacy* and rational discourse to shift public opinion.\n   - A "mutant strain" has emerged where extreme ideas are used tactically to shift perceptions.\n\n2. Critique of the Mutant Overton Window\n\n   - The mutant version allows for sloppy advocacy by rationalizing support for extreme ideas.\n   - It suggests backing unsound principles for tactical advantage, which is criticized as *wrong* and counterproductive.\n   - The original premise acknowledges the significance of *genuine persuasion* in promoting ideas.\n\n3. Historical and Political Examples\n\n   - **Marriage equality** and **marijuana legalization** are cited as examples of successful Overton shifts.\n     - Historical advocacy and shifting social norms gradually made these ideas politically viable.\n   - Contrasted with ineffective uses, like *extreme rhetoric* in immigration or police reform.\n\n4. Applications in Policy and Advocacy\n\n   - *Persuasion* and providing technical information to policymakers can drive realistic policy changes.\n   - The Biden administration’s use of policy knowledge to enact immediate benefits is highlighted.\n   - **Single-payer health care** is discussed as a substantive idea pushed by advocates like Sanders that shaped political discourse.\n\n5. Criticisms and Misunderstandings\n\n   - Incorrect application involves using outrageous ideas to make less extreme ones appear moderate.\n   - This approach can backfire, leading to a lack of real policy change and increased political avoidance.\n   - Some activists see it as a political tool, ignoring if the ideas themselves are logically sound.\n\n6. The Need for Rigorous Advocacy\n\n   - Effective advocacy requires logic, evidence, and thoughtful persuasion rather than mere shock tactics.\n   - Donors should support advocates with *credible ideas* and strong argumentation rather than those jumping on viral trends.\n   - The focus should be on funding rigorous and *persuasive thought leaders*, not attention-seekers.\n\n7. Conclusion and Recommendations\n\n   - Success in policy advocacy comes from convincing others of sound ideas through well-reasoned arguments.\n   - The concept of the Overton Window calls for genuine discourse, not manipulation through extreme positioning.\n   - Political change requires the involvement of thoughtful innovators who prioritize clarity and evidence in advocacy.'},{id:0x1ee178b,title:"A better criticism of Biden's COVID-19 relief plan",subtitle:"Expect a low fiscal multiplier ",date:"2021-02-11",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/relief-multiplier",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1775,comment_count:55,likes:46,category:"Legislative Strategies and Challenges",summary:"1. **Introduction and Overview**\n\n   - Revisits a previous article to critique the budget math by economist Ernie Tedeschi.\n   - The relief plan is criticized for being *wasteful* and delivering funds not strictly needed.\n   - Inflation concerns are dismissed, but the package's effectiveness is questioned.\n\n2. **Tedeschi's Perspective**\n\n   - Disagrees with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on the output gap size.\n     - CBO estimates a $50 billion monthly gap; Tedeschi argues for $150 billion.\n   - Critique: The plan is too front-loaded, delivering too much money too quickly.\n\n3. **Economic Multiplier Discussion**\n\n   - A high fiscal multiplier leads to more GDP growth per dollar spent.\n   - Paul Krugman's explanation: Multiplier effects create a chain reaction of spending.\n   - The Biden plan lacks a high multiplier impact for several reasons:\n     - It addresses supply-side issues and public health, not purely economic growth.\n\n4. **State and Local Government Aid**\n\n   - Aid will vary in effect:\n     - Some states have budget shortfalls and will see immediate benefits.\n     - Others, like California, have surpluses and may not need immediate aid.\n   - Impact: Money may sit unused, reducing multiplier effectiveness.\n\n5. **Opportunity Costs**\n\n   - Debate on whether the $1.9 trillion package is warranted as spent.\n   - Criticisms include:\n     - Failure to invest more in high-multiplier infrastructure projects.\n     - Lack of automatic stabilizers in the relief plan.\n   - Alternative suggestion: Use mechanisms like the FMAP payments to target state aid effectively.\n\n6. **Political Capital and Popularity**\n\n   - Concerns about Biden using political capital for a suboptimal plan.\n   - Polls suggest the plan is popular and may not damage Biden's political standing.\n\n7. **Future Considerations**\n\n   - Potential for a second infrastructure-focused recovery plan.\n   - Goal: Utilize funds for actual infrastructure rather than as a job creation scheme."},{id:0x1eea478,title:"The misguided exam school debate ",subtitle:"Selective public high schools have few Black and Hispanic students — there's also no evidence these schools are any good",date:"2021-02-12",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-misguided-exam-school-debate",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1938,comment_count:378,likes:177,category:"Evolving Dynamics in U.S. K-12 Education",summary:"1. **Background and Context**\n\n   - San Francisco's Board of Education recently garnered attention:\n     - Engaged in a controversial school renaming campaign.\n     - Schools remain closed due to the pandemic, contrary to public health advice.\n   - Changes proposed for Lowell High School's admissions policy due to low Black and Latino student representation.\n     - Criticized by the San Francisco Chronicle.\n     - Related debates occurring in New York City and Fairfax County concerning exam-based high schools.\n\n2. **Issues with Selective Schools**\n\n   - Schools may promote segregation rather than racial justice.\n   - Predominantly attended by Asian students, creating political implications.\n   - Little evidence that selective schools benefit students:\n     - **Dobbie and Fryer (2013)**: No significant impact on college metrics in NYC.\n     - **Abdulkadriglu et al.

Political dynamics could lead to the ARP's temporary benefits becoming permanent or fade due to fiscal constraints.\n   - Future decisions hinge on elections, congressional control, and internal Democratic consensus.\n   - Biden’s major campaign policies focused on expansion of services rather than direct cash benefits.\n\n6. **Congressional Power and Presidential Influence**\n\n   - The legislative agenda is often shaped by Congress's priorities:\n     - Example: Health care reform under Obama was driven by Congressional leadership.\n   - Biden's presidency illustrates the need for presidents to align with congressional goals.\n   - Executive actions are limited by party consensus and internal opposition is carefully managed.\n\n7. **Electoral Success and Policy Outcomes**\n\n   - Winning elections is emphasized as pivotal for policy success:\n     - GOP learned this through Trump's presidency, which despite controversies, delivered conservative policy victories.\n     - Conversely, Romney's loss illustrated the limits of ideological purity over electoral success.\n   - Progressive enthusiasm should consider the broader electoral dynamics rather than solely focusing on detailed policy endorsements.\n\n8. **Conclusion: Stakes and Future Directions**\n\n   - The transformative potential of the Biden presidency is linked to electoral outcomes and congressional dynamics.\n   - Success means potentially significant progressive policy evolution; failure could mean a swing towards conservative policies.\n   - The future of ARP initiatives and welfare expansions are at stake, necessitating strategic choices in policy priorities."},{id:0x2048acd,title:"Weekend update, March 20",subtitle:"Takes... hot and fast",date:"2021-03-20",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/weekend-update-march-20",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1082,comment_count:413,likes:128,category:"Reflections on Pandemic Responses",summary:"1. **Vaccination and Family Reunions**\n\n   -

Lessons from Past Economic Events\n\n   - The 2015-2016 period and the “invisible recession”:\n     - Inflation dropped due to external events, yet interest rates were raised.\n     - Resulted in a recessionary impact on agriculture, energy, and manufacturing sectors.\n     - Economic visibility improves under NGDP terms.\n\n5. Advantages of NGDP in Modern Policy-Making\n\n   - Provides clearer criteria for policy adjustment:\n     - Focus on *steady NGDP growth* rather than inflation-driven policies.\n     - Non-monetary issues (e.g., canal blockages) require non-monetary solutions.\n   - Enhances communication:\n     - NGDP targeting imagines explanations around *spending and incomes* rather than purely inflation-focused narratives.\n\n6. Rethinking Central Banking Philosophy\n\n   - Influence of the 1970s economic experiences on today’s monetary policies:\n     - Historic fear of excessive stimulus and inflation.\n   - Need for a new perspective:\n     - The last two decades challenge the single focus on limiting stimulus.\n     - NGDP targeting as a means to ensure nominal income growth, leaving productivity increases to elected officials.\n\n7. Future Outlook for the Federal Reserve \n\n   - Opportunities for reform:\n     - Recent reviews suggest readiness for considering NGDP targeting.\n     - Recommends separating stimulus assurance from the pursuit of productivity.\n   - Long-term goal: Achieving clarity and flexibility in monetary policy by moving from inflation targets to nominal income targets.\n\nBy switching to NGDP targeting, the proposal aims to mitigate inappropriate monetary responses to transient economic shocks, thus fostering a more stable economic environment."},{id:0x20e82eb,title:"Did the Democratic Majority emerge after all?",subtitle:"Revising a political classic ",date:"2021-04-01",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/did-the-democratic-majority-emerge",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2016,comment_count:209,likes:99,category:"Strategies and Challenges in Modern Politics",summary:"1. **Overview of Political Trends**\n\n   - Discussion centered on trends described in Ruy Teixeira and John Judis' 2004 book, *The Emerging Democratic Majority*.\n   - **Demographic Shifts**:\n     - Anticipated trends, such as the increasing nonwhite share of the electorate and liberalism in educated professionals, materialized.\n     - Contrast between forecasted Democratic dominance and actual political outcomes due to electoral and geographic factors.\n\n2. **Comparative Historical Context**\n\n   - **Kevin Phillips’ 1969 Book Reference**:\n     - Cited as a comparable work, highlighting a \"Republican majority\" era.\n     - GOP's electoral victories in the 1970s-80s considered a *vindication* of Phillips’ thesis.\n     - Note on Democrats' Congressional power balanced against presidential and judicial deference.\n\n3. **Electoral Outcomes since the Book’s Publication**\n\n   - **Presidential and Congressional Wins**:\n     - Democrats won three out of five presidential elections.\n     - Strong congressional presence, surpassing the GOP’s past achievements during its majority period.\n   - **Vote Majority**:\n     - Democrats secured majorities in House votes (2012) and Senate votes in multiple years.\n     - Geographic skew affects actual power despite favorable voting outcomes.\n\n4. **Policy Shifts and Social Progress**\n\n   - **Policy Evolution**:\n     - Environmental, wealth redistribution, and social policies evolved favoring liberal agendas.\n     - *Significant transformations in LGBT rights*.\n   - **Economic and Social Welfare**:\n     - Notable expansions in minimum wage and welfare programs.\n     - Expanded federal benefits and social policies under both Bush and Obama.\n\n5. **Challenges in Political Forecasting**\n\n   - **Unanticipated Factors**:\n     - Liberalism in metro areas indirectly shifted Democratic platforms, alienating some voter bases.\n     - Immigration debate evolution highlights difficulties in long-term predictions.\n   - **Electoral Dynamics**:\n     - Electoral system's geographic skew plays a crucial role in party successes and failures.\n\n6. **Contemporary and Future Political Landscape**\n\n   - Republicans’ economic policy critique, lacking popularity despite electoral success.\n   - *Uncertainty in future political landscapes* and predictions.\n   - Foreseeable challenges for Democrats in upcoming midterms due to historical midterm losses.\n   - Potential outcomes based on voter distribution and electoral map skews.\n\n7. **Final Reflections**\n\n   - Acknowledgment of the unpredictable nature of politics and challenges in making accurate forecasts.\n   - The interplay between voter demographics, party ideology, and electoral mechanics remains complex and difficult to predict accurately in the long term."},{id:0x20eecc4,title:"Andrew Yang versus the unrepresentative activists",subtitle:"Even in an NYC primary, nobody really cares what left-wing activists think",date:"2021-04-09",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/yang-gang",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2625,comment_count:521,likes:220,category:"Strategies and Challenges in Modern Politics",summary:"1.

The article links Kahlenberg's argument to broader themes, such as marijuana reform, often framed in racial justice terms.\n\n2. **Public Perception and Framing**\n\n   - Research indicates land use reform is more appealing as an economic growth initiative than as a racial justice initiative.\n   - Most voters resonate more with politicians addressing their direct concerns, primarily economic rather than racial.\n\n3. **Historical Context and Economic Implications**\n\n   - Historically, American land-use regulations supported residential segregation but have proven to be economically detrimental.\n   -

The article addresses the complicated debate around *“wokeness”* and *“cancel culture.”*\n   - Focuses on discussing one specific document: [“The Characteristics of White Supremacy Culture”](https://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/white-supremacy-culture-characteristics.html) by Tema Okun.\n   - The document has gained traction in progressive circles despite limited endorsement from prominent thinkers.\n\n2. **About the Document**\n\n   - Originally part of the book *Dismantling Racism: A Workbook for Social Change Groups*.\n   - Intended as a tool for consulting and training, but not typically seen as highbrow or intellectually influential.\n   - Widely circulated within various progressive organizations but criticized for not truly being about race.\n\n3. **Key Criticisms of the Document**\n\n   - **Disconnection from Race:**\n     - The document critiques characteristics like “either/or thinking” and “perfectionism,” without clear ties to race or white supremacy.\n     - Okun admits these traits aren't exclusively linked to white people, noting cultural rather than racial influences.\n\n   - **Focus on Organizational Processes:**\n     - Attributes focused on process over results as part of white supremacy culture.\n     - Suggests urgency and measurability devalue inclusiveness and democratic decision-making.\n\n   - **Impact on Functionality:**\n     - Adopting the document’s ideas may harm organizational efficiency by labeling typical management practices as racially oppressive.\n\n4. **Wider Influence and Concerns**\n\n   - Despite its perceived flaws, the document has influenced public school systems, unions, and various organizations.\n   - Its principles may hinder practical goals, like educational achievements or conservation efforts.\n   - A concern is that labeling basic competencies (e.g., written communication) as white supremacy can derail effective operations.\n\n5. **The Role of Broad Influence in Progressive Circles**\n\n   - **Influence in Education and Organizations:**\n     - Public school systems and unions utilize the document, sometimes resulting in ineffective policy applications.\n     - Okun's ideas permeate professional and educational spaces through widespread training programs.\n\n   - **Cultural and Ideological Impact:**\n     - Promotes a generalized aversion to hierarchy, not representative of broader racial communities but resonating with specific ideological subsections.\n\n6. **Conclusion and Broader Implications**\n\n   - The document's influence raises questions about its impact on pedagogy and organizational effectiveness.\n   - The author advocates for critical examination and open debate on such widespread resources.\n   - Emphasizes the importance of evidence-based teachings, warning against adopting concepts that lack rigorous support. \n\n7. **Final Thoughts**\n\n   - Encourages scrutiny of claims made under the guise of racial justice, promoting transparent and logical discourse.\n   -

The University of California's decision to drop SAT/ACT requirements reflects a broader trend against standardized testing.\n   - Concerns center on achieving diversity in college admissions, especially for Black and Latino students.\n   - Asian students tend to score higher on these tests than white students, raising questions about the implications of diversity-oriented initiatives targeting overrepresented groups.\n\n2. **Criticism of the Anti-Test Movement**\n\n   - Many critiques of standardized tests, such as the claim they are gamed by wealthier families, are misleading.\n     - Studies show a modest correlation between parental income and SAT scores, similar to correlations found in other educational outcomes.\n     - Test prep's benefits are modest, mainly offering familiarity rather than significant score boosts.\n   - SATs aim to reflect academic skill, offering a meritocratic sorting tool rather than being an inherently flawed measure.\n\n3. **Predictive Validity of Standardized Tests**\n\n   - Contrary to some claims, SAT scores, along with high school GPAs, predict college success and are not poor predictors when range restriction is accounted for.\n     - Studies confirm the effectiveness of SAT/ACT scores as indicators of college and professional achievement.\n\n4. **Sorting Systems in Education**\n\n   - The debate includes whether academic aptitude should be a major sorting criterion.\n     - Some advocate universal testing to prevent privileged students from dominating access to college opportunities.\n   - Alternatives, like Texas's top percentage admissions policy, could broaden access by emphasizing school-based rankings over standardized scores.\n\n5. **Criticism of Academic Achievement Metrics**\n\n   - Ibram Kendi and others argue that testing reflects systemic racism due to racial disparities in scores.\n     - This perspective contends that academic achievement measures might perpetuate elitism over diverse competencies.\n\n6. **Educational Resource Allocation**\n\n   - More egalitarian outcomes might be achieved by reallocating resources toward schools attended by less privileged students.\n     - Community colleges, serving numerous students from modest backgrounds, face low completion rates and thus need financial support to improve outcomes.\n\n7. **Policy Recommendations and Reflections**\n\n   - Addressing inequality involves enhancing support for students at institutions like community colleges rather than focusing solely on testing reform.\n     - Proposals in the American Families Plan, such as increased support for community colleges and Pell Grants, could provide substantial aid to those most in need.\n   -

Distinction Between Bigness and Monopoly\n\n   - Opposition to bigness often misuses the term “monopoly”.\n     - *Example*: Political figures criticizing Amazon as a monopoly without it fitting the standard definition.\n   - True monopolies, like utility companies, are defined by exclusive service in a geographic area.\n\n3. Anti-Bigness vs. Antitrust\n\n   - Anti-bigness advocates focus on firm size, while antitrust looks at competitive practices.\n   - Historic laws (e.g., pre-1980 bank branching restrictions) illustrate anti-bigness was sometimes anti-competitive.\n\n4. Criticism of Amazon\n\n   - Amazon is often accused of monopolistic behaviors in e-commerce and cloud services.\n     - Critics mention practices like high fees and restricting sellers.\n   - However, Amazon's dominance is not synonymous with having a monopoly due to significant market competition.\n\n5. Market Dynamics and Competition\n\n   - Retail and e-commerce are inherently competitive, yet critics focus disproportionately on Amazon.\n   - Online retailing is potentially more competitive than traditional retail, making allegations of monopolization misplaced.\n   - Other companies (e.g., Walmart, Target) offer alternative shopping experiences.\n\n6. Broader Retail Practices\n\n   - The criticism of Amazon’s business tactics isn't limited to e-commerce; similar practices occur in brick-and-mortar retail.\n     - *Example*: Retailers using sales data to create competitive store brands.\n   \n7. Role of New Business Models\n\n   - Emerging commerce models bypass traditional logistic methods; rely on platforms like Shopify.\n   - Shows the adaptability of the market beyond monolithic providers like Amazon.\n\n8. Misinterpretation of Amazon's Market Position\n\n   - The e-book market provides an example where Amazon’s perceived dominance obscures realities of consumer choice and platform competition.\n   - The broader market needs more competitors, but that doesn't equate to Amazon holding a monopoly.\n\n9. Conclusion: Understanding Anti-Bigness\n\n   - Anti-bigness is focused on the scale rather than the competitive nature of companies.\n   - There must be a precise understanding of issues before labeling companies like Amazon as monopolistic.\n   - The anti-bigness stance can unintentionally obstruct competition and miss the actual issue of monopolization."},{id:0x235ba1e,title:"The experts underrate full employment",subtitle:"Good things happen when people get jobs",date:"2021-06-03",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/underrating-full-employment",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:3109,comment_count:186,likes:154,category:"Economic Policies and Partisan Divides",summary:"1. **Introduction**\n\n   -

Introduction\n\n   - **California Assembly law**: Prohibits local governments from imposing minimum parking requirements near public transit.\n   - **Potential impact**: Aims to unlock housing but depends on broader land-use reforms.\n   - *Efficacy*: Depends on accompanying zoning changes.\n\n2. Parking Minimums and Housing\n\n   - **Barrier to development**: Parking minimums hinder urban development and inflate housing costs.\n     - Example: Minneapolis saw a reduction in rents after reducing parking minimums.\n   - **Cost implications**: Garage parking increases rental costs.\n   - **Spatial impact**: Mandates lock in land-use patterns.\n\n3. Legal and Regulatory Landscape\n\n   - **Example from D.C.**: Parking rules combined with other regulations affect property use.\n     - Consequences: Restrictive lot occupancy rules in D.C. dilute the impact of parking deregulation.\n   - **Comparison with Houston**: Different regulatory emphasis, with parking rules acting as zoning.\n\n4. The Discourse on Parking Mandates\n\n   - **Public perception**: Often framed as a debate on parking's value.\n   - **Market dynamics**: People typically purchase useful commodities unless regulations mandate otherwise.\n\n5. Externalities and Market Interactions\n\n   - **Regulatory rationale**: Traditionally framed as addressing parking externalities.\n   - **Market approach**:\n     - Regulation is inappropriate for pecuniary externalities.\n     - **Solutions**: Market pricing or private parking arrangements.\n\n6. Innovation in Transportation\n\n   - **Technological advances**: E-bikes, scooter sharing, etc., offer alternatives to car dependency.\n   - **Potential benefits**: Could complement mass transit and reduce car ownership.\n   - **Current issues**: Innovations have not significantly reduced car dependence.\n\n7. Legislative Dynamics\n\n   - **California bill support**: Bipartisan backing, despite some progressive opposition.\n   - **Opposition reasons**: Calls for regulatory trade-offs with affordable housing initiatives.\n   - **Importance**: Relaxing parking mandates improves housing affordability broadly, not only through designated affordable units.\n\n8. Traffic and NIMBYism Concerns\n\n   - **Traffic issues**: Legitimate concerns over increased traffic due to new housing.\n   - **Solution**: State-level regulation should prioritize broader impacts over local parochial interests.\n  \n9.

Introduction\n\n   - The article discusses the relationship between **racial equity** and the **welfare state**.\n   - It suggests that extending welfare benefits can substantially advance racial equity by redistributing resources to less affluent Americans.\n\n2. Welfare State and Racial Equity\n\n   - The **Biden Families Plan** aims to support less affluent Americans, indirectly supporting racial equity.\n     - Redistribution benefits help close the racial wealth gap, as highlighted in “The Racial Wealth Gap is a Class Gap."\n   - Concerns arise when **race-blind policies** are marketed as racial equity initiatives.\n     - Acknowledging deep-rooted **racism** in politics is crucial, as race-neutral framing may dilute the intended impact.\n\n3. Critical Race Theory and Political Dynamics\n\n   - **Interest-convergence** is a key idea from Critical Race Theory, where significant political actions occur when deemed beneficial by politically decisive white people.\n   - Historical arguments against associating welfare with race aimed to prevent perpetuating stereotypes and negative attitudes towards assistance programs.\n\n4. Race and Class Correlation\n\n   - Cities like Washington, D.C., demonstrate a strong correlation between race and class, which is not reflective of the broader U.S. context.\n     - Although race and class are correlated nationally, there are many low-income whites who would benefit from redistributive policies.\n\n5. Political Implications for Democrats\n\n   - Democrats need to emphasize that their policies benefit **low-income whites** alongside minorities.\n   - Historical analyses like W.E.B. DuBois’ work highlight the psychological and material gains racism provides certain white populations, which complicates their voting dynamics.\n\n6. Voter Behavior and Policy Communication\n\n   - The **Republican Party\'s** attempts to moderate issues like Social Security complicate Democratic strategies.\n   - Effective campaigning should address benefits to low-income demographics across all racial backgrounds.\n\n7. Ideological Considerations\n\n   - "Privilege" and its deployment in discourse need re-evaluation to include struggling whites not perceived as privileged.\n   - The campaign messaging should focus on **material benefits** rather than identity politics alone.\n\n8. Communication Strategies\n\n   - Avoid racial focus in welfare state advocacy; instead, communicate the universal benefits.\n   - Some organizations unintentionally prioritize racial narratives over class and do not sufficiently highlight the broad demographic benefits of policies.\n\n9. Conclusion\n\n   - The article stresses the importance of organizing a movement that clearly communicates the **inclusive benefits** of a progressive agenda.\n   - By appealing to the self-interest of all, including non-affluent whites, the welfare state\'s positive impact can be better realized across communities.'},{id:0x23b5915,title:"Why we got more inflation than I expected",subtitle:"My first big forecasting error ",date:"2021-06-14",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/inflation-georgia-checks",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:3550,comment_count:110,likes:143,category:"Interpreting Economic Forces and Policy Responses",summary:"1. **Forecasting and Inflation Error**\n\n   - Initial Forecast\n     - The author made a confident prediction that core inflation would not exceed 3% in 2021.\n     - Actual outcome: The BLS reported a core inflation of 3.8% in May, highlighting a forecasting error.\n   - Reflection\n     - Admits to the possibility of a poor forecasting track record but views quantitative forecasting as a learning experience.\n     - Emphasizes the importance of honesty and transparency in forecasting within the punditry.\n\n2. **Election Predictions and Stimulus Surprises**\n\n   - Georgia Elections\n     - Predicted with 60% confidence that Ossoff and Warnock would win the special elections.\n     - Recognized the influence of Trump’s behavior on the election dynamics.\n   - American Rescue Plan (ARP) Surprises\n     - Unexpectedly large $1.9 trillion stimulus post Georgia win.\n     - Initial expectation was for a more modest Republican-controlled Senate with limited Covid relief.\n\n3. **Current Inflation Channels**\n\n   - Small Business Concerns\n     - Impact of the $300/week Unemployment Insurance bonus, influencing wage discussions and political narratives.\n   - Reopening Inflation\n     - Anticipated increase in demand for travel and leisure activities as restrictions eased.\n     - Example: Hotels and travel prices rising due to temporary demand surges.\n   - Durable Goods Demand\n     - Increased spending on durable goods such as home renovations and electronics.\n     - Contributing factors include high personal savings and limited alternative spending opportunities during the pandemic.\n\n4. **Supply Constraints and Economic Adjustments**\n\n   - Production Challenges\n     - Global supply constraints, particularly affecting the car industry due to semiconductor shortages.\n     - Demand miscalculations by manufacturers during the pandemic led to supply issues as demand rebounded.\n   - Policy and Market Responses\n     - Recommendations for federal actions like reducing fleet size to alleviate used car market stress.\n     - Potential tariffs removal to reduce costs in sectors with rising prices, like durable goods.\n\n5. **Inflation Expectations and Future Outlook**\n\n   - Present Inflation Drivers\n     - Current inflation largely due to scarcity and cost-push factors.\n     - So far, no significant inflation driven by psychological expectations of rising prices.\n   - Importance of Government Action\n     - Advocates for government attention to inflation to prevent broader economic impacts.\n     - Suggests that some current concerns are manageable, viewing them as indicators of economic health rather than systemic issues."},{id:0x23c00eb,title:"What's the matter with Stephen Breyer (and Merrick Garland)?",subtitle:"Why Democrats can't find a wartime consigliere ",date:"2021-06-30",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/whats-the-matter-with-stephen-breyer",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2158,comment_count:334,likes:139,category:"Modern Political Challenges and Global Dynamics",summary:"1.

The pandemic and racial justice protests are both considered factors, yet they don\'t solely account for the surge.\n   - The "de-policing" thesis suggests anti-police sentiment may have influenced a nationwide reduction in policing activity.\n\n5. **Political Variability and Sparse Data**\n\n   - Examining variations in murder trends related to political leadership is challenging due to limited data.\n     - *Examples*: Mixed results in cities like Jacksonville (higher murder rates) and El Paso (lower murder rates).\n\n6. **Importance of Detailed Data**\n\n   - Having comprehensive homicide statistics could clarify various debates about crime trends.\n     - Questions could include geographical, racial, and political correlations with murder rates.\n\n7. **Mystery of Divergent Crime Trends**\n\n   - Despite a drop in certain crimes (e.g., burglaries), murder rates increased, which diverges from typical crime trajectory patterns.\n   - Lower public trust in police could explain underreporting of smaller crimes while more serious ones increase.\n\n8. **Education Data Challenges**\n\n   - Cultural debates over school curriculums, from critical race theory to historical perspectives, reflect discrepancies in data and reporting.\n     - Examples of extreme teaching practices exist, but the scale and impact are unknown due to limited data.\n\n9. **Value of Accurate Data**\n\n   -

Introduction\n\n   - Transitioning to a *cleaner and more sustainable future* involves converting home heating and passenger travel to electricity.\n   - To support this transition, we need to power the electrical grid with zero-carbon fuels, requiring more electrical transmission lines.\n   - Key challenges include:\n     - **Permitting and regulation**: Coordinating across multiple state agencies for approval.\n     - The lack of incentives for states to approve interstate projects due to diffuse benefits.\n\n2. Current Approaches and Challenges\n\n   - Natural gas projects can bypass some state hurdles through the *Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)*.\n   - Legal challenges exist, as demonstrated by a 2005 provision which courts undermined by interpreting denial of permits differently than delays.\n\n3. Whitehouse and Quigley's Proposal: The SITE Act\n\n   - Aims to streamline the permitting process by:\n     - Creating a new class of significant interstate projects managed by FERC.\n     - Offering a preemption of state authority for significant projects.\n   - Attempts to balance landowner rights with expedited approvals by:\n     - Providing more prompt and rigorous notifications.\n     - Implementing quick resolutions of disputes through fast-track legal proceedings.\n\n4. Importance for Zero-Carbon Electricity\n\n   - Interregional electrical connections support balancing *idiosyncratic surges and shortages* in power supply and demand.\n   - Specific challenges related to zero-carbon electricity include:\n     - Geographic mismatches between resources and population centers.\n     - The need for interconnections to address the intermittency of renewable energies like wind and solar.\n\n5. Economic Impact and Modeling\n\n   - Patrick Brown and Auden Botterud's research shows that robust interregional interconnections could:\n     - Lower the cost of an all-renewables power system by over 40%.\n     - Reduce cost from $135/MWh to $73/MWh.\n   - Highlights that **boring grid permitting issues** significantly impact costs.\n\n6. Regulatory and Political Implications\n\n   - *Public utility commissions (PUCs)* resist losing authority, complicating transmission line development.\n   - Fragmented permitting authority negatively affects renewable energy deployment compared to fossil fuels.\n   - Addressing these issues could reduce energy costs for consumers, appealing to various political interests.\n\n7. Path Forward and Broader Implications\n\n   - Wyatt and blue states can both benefit from improved interstate transmission, supporting clean electricity standards.\n   - A key opportunity lies in leveraging legislative vehicles to advance climate priorities without needing a comprehensive \"climate bill.\"\n   - The regulatory system needs adjustment from being fossil fuel-centric to supporting the near-term clean energy future.\n\n8. Key Takeaways\n\n   - Transitioning to zero-carbon requires tackling regulatory hurdles more than technological ones.\n   - Bipartisan support can be garnered by focusing on consumer energy costs and regional economic benefits.\n   - Permitting reform is pivotal for making cleaner energy cheaper and more accessible."},{id:0x24e4c6e,title:"Here are some ways to change things",subtitle:'There\'s more to life than "activism" ',date:"2021-07-15",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/change-not-activism",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1661,comment_count:204,likes:202,category:"Complex Interplay of Politics and Policy",summary:'1.

The article challenges Paul Krugman\'s view on pro-natalism.\n   - Krugman argues against economic incentives for larger families, suggesting motivations are rooted in "family values" or racial subtexts.\n   - The author believes the economic rationale for investing in parents and children is strong and such policies should appeal across political lines.\n\n2. **Economic Argument for Pro-Natalism**\n\n   - **Investment in Families**  \n     - Public policy should support families through financial incentives:\n       - *Child allowances*\n       - *Paid parental leave*\n       - *Publicly funded child programs*\n     - These policies can reduce child poverty and encourage larger families.\n   - **Effects on Innovation and Growth**\n     - Larger populations fuel innovation and contribute to long-term economic growth.\n     - Invested money in families boosts population growth and reduces "secular stagnation," thereby enhancing demand for private capital.\n\n3. **Krugman\'s Concessions**\n\n   - Despite skepticism, Krugman acknowledges:\n     - *“French fertility is higher due to supportive policies.”*\n     - *“More spending on children enhances future productivity and health.”*\n   - Nevertheless, he emphasizes the quality of upbringing over the quantity of births.\n   \n4. **Political and Social Considerations**\n\n   - **Right-of-Center Appeal**\n     - Policy should embrace "family values" to appeal to conservatives rather than dismiss the notion as racist.\n   - **Technology and Specialization**\n     - Large populations enable more specialization, fostering technological advancements.\n   - **Racism and Fertility**\n     - Claims that pro-natalism is *racist* are unfounded. It benefits all demographics.\n     - Current proposals aim for equality and innovation rather than demographic manipulation.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Recommendations**\n\n   - Acknowledging personal preferences for family size, the author argues for collaboration with diverse viewpoints.\n   - Pro-natalist policies should be seen as sensible investments in future economic prosperity and societal benefits.\n   - Policymakers should focus on inclusive support for parents and children to foster a brighter economic future.'},{id:0x25751e4,title:"To means-test or not to means-test ",subtitle:"Better fewer programs, but better",date:"2021-07-30",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/means-test-when",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2601,comment_count:68,likes:57,category:"Exploring Welfare and Economic Policy Reforms",summary:"1. **Introduction to Means-Testing vs Universal Programs**\n\n   -

Introduction \n\n   - The American Medical Association (AMA), as a significant trade group for doctors, influences healthcare policy.\n   - In collaboration with the American Association of Medical Colleges, the AMA released a guide focusing on language and concepts related to health equity.\n\n2. Language and Narrative Changes Suggested by AMA\n\n   - **Recommended terms:**\n     - “Groups that have been economically/socially marginalized” instead of “marginalized communities.”\n     - “Inequities” instead of “disparities.”\n   - **Language adjustments:**\n     - “Formerly incarcerated” instead of “ex-cons.”\n     - “Enslaved people” instead of “slaves.”\n   - *Advises ideological shifts* in how health issues are discussed.\n\n3. Criticisms and Concerns\n\n   - **Critics:**\n     - Conor Friedersdorf and Alex Tabarrok express concerns about “politicizing medicine” and the alienation it might cause.\n   - **Main criticism:**\n     - The AMA\'s suggestions appear disconnected from their policy actions. \n     - It is believed these linguistic changes do not address major healthcare issues.\n\n4. AMA’s Missed Potential in Policy Influence\n\n   - **Key Points:**\n     - The document suggests using "equity-focused language" but lacks substantive policy analysis.\n     - Issues like Native American public health point to broader systemic failings.\n   - **Policy inaction:**\n     - The current health system shortage is partly due to AMA policies, affecting medical care access.\n\n5. Fundamental Health Disparities Ignored \n\n   - **Lack of doctors**: \n     - U.S. has fewer doctors per capita compared to other wealthy nations.\n   - Results: \n     - Higher costs and less accessibility for those in impoverished or rural areas.\n   - AMA’s actions limiting foreign-trained doctors and nurse practitioners compound these issues.\n\n6. Historical and Present AMA Actions\n\n   - **Historical opposition**: \n     - Critical in blocking major healthcare reforms like Truman’s universal health care.\n   - **Current stances**:\n     - Opposes expanding Medicare and public healthcare options.\n\n7. Linguistic Changes versus Structural Reforms\n\n   - **Perspective insights**:\n     - Emphasis on changing terminologies does not address root issues.\n   - **Social bias**:\n     - Racial and socioeconomic biases affect healthcare outcomes.\n\n8. Core Policy Changes for Improvement\n\n   - **Recommended approaches**:\n     - Increase healthcare provider availability.\n     - Reallocation of resources and systemic healthcare reforms.\n   - **Challenges**:\n     - Influence from strong interest groups and the AMA.\n\n9. Conclusion \n\n   - Greater focus should be on tangible healthcare reforms rather than language changes.\n   - Real progress necessitates addressing AMA’s influence on healthcare scarcity, advocating for policies that are understandable and aligned with public values.'},{id:0x2a129cf,title:"On what matters",subtitle:"Taking stock of the most important topics ",date:"2021-11-18",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/on-what-matters",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2485,comment_count:247,likes:179,category:"Complex Interplay of Politics and Policy",summary:"1. **Introduction and Context**\n\n   - Slow Boring marks its first anniversary with a reflection on key global issues.\n   - Importance is measured by what future perspectives might deem consequential.\n   - Some local issues, like violence in cities, may not hold long-term global significance compared to others.\n\n2. **Climate Change**\n\n   - **Policy Challenges**\n     - Activists focus on specific temperature rise limits.\n     - Political and economic difficulties hinder policy alignment with these targets.\n   - **Risk Assessment**\n     - High-risk scenarios (RCP 8.5) are less likely due to advancements in technology and cheaper renewables.\n     - Catastrophic outcomes appear less probable, but the fight against climate change continues.\n   - **Policy Recommendations**\n     - Target-setting is less impactful than implementing zero-carbon energy solutions.\n     - Emphasis on scalable solutions to mitigate warming beyond 2 degrees.\n\n3. **Child Poverty in the United States**\n\n   - **Moral and Social Concerns**\n     - High child poverty rates are a critical issue, highlighting flaws in the U.S. social model.\n     - Covid relief measures temporarily alleviated child poverty by expanding financial support.\n   - **Current Legislative Context**\n     - Impact of the expanded Child Tax Credit varies, with proposed variations on its effectiveness.\n     - Political will and focus determine the permanence and impact of these welfare initiatives.\n\n4. **Economic Growth and Development**\n\n   - **Factors Influencing Growth**\n     - Scientific and technical advancements play a pivotal role.\n     - Housing as a key asset in wealth accumulation.\n   - **Policy Developments**\n     - Bipartisan efforts to increase science funding face challenges in execution.\n     - Housing reforms like those in California show promise but require expansion into other states.\n\n5. **Pandemic Preparedness and Response**\n\n   - **Lessons from Covid-19**\n     - Despite awareness, emergent pathogens remain lower priorities for policymakers.\n     - Bipartisan interests in pandemic defense vary, with some divergence seen in the Republican response.\n   - **Current Concerns**\n     - Anti-vaccine sentiment complicates public health efforts.\n     - New emerging threats, like bird flu, require attention and foresight.\n\n6. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Concerns**\n\n   - **AI Risks**\n     - Growing awareness about AI safety and control.\n     - Limited policy strategies to address potential AI risks globally due to complexities.\n   - **Lack of Concrete Solutions**\n     - Although discourse exists, actionable policies remain underdeveloped.\n\n7. **China-US Relations and Global Leadership**\n\n   - **Geopolitical Tensions**\n     - Debate over appropriate responses to China's growing influence.\n     - Taiwan remains a focal point with increased defense spending but strategy scrutinized.\n   - **Strategic Vision**\n     - The importance of sustaining U.S. leadership independently of China's potential economic downturns.\n     - Calls for a composite strategy that encompasses economic, diplomatic, and defense dimensions.\n\n8. **Cultural Versus Material Issues in Politics**\n\n   - **Symbolism in Current Discourse**\n     - Politics increasingly centered on cultural symbolism over tangible policy impacts.\n     - Symbolic issues, while meaningful, often overshadow crucial material concerns.\n   - **Call to Action**\n     - Advocacy for a focus on concrete policies that yield measurable progress.\n     - Material issues hold greater potential for compromise and societal advancement than cultural symbols."},{id:0x2a1e3e3,title:"The real world is nominal ",subtitle:"Central banks shouldn’t target inflation at all — they should stabilize nominal spending",date:"2021-11-19",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-real-world-is-nominal",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2570,comment_count:140,likes:83,category:"Interpreting Economic Forces and Policy Responses",summary:'1.

Current Labor Market Dynamics\n\n   - Both the quits and hires rates are at historic highs, maintaining a normal hires-to-quits ratio.\n   - People are switching jobs for better opportunities rather than leaving the workforce entirely.\n     - Example: Switching jobs for better positions in the same industry.\n   - High quits rates correlate with strong hiring demand driven by economic recovery efforts.\n\n3. Contributing Factors\n\n   - Businesses reopening as pandemic restrictions ease and elevated consumer demand fueling hiring booms.\n   - A significant portion of hires comes from those already employed, rather than from unemployed individuals.\n     - Many sectors, like healthcare, experience high quits due to intense demand for skilled workers.\n\n4. Misunderstandings and Misinterpretations\n\n   - There are misconceptions about the reasons behind the high quit rates, such as political statements or misconceptions about unemployment benefits.\n   - Some portray quits as political acts or strikes, which oversimplifies the situation.\n\n5. Policy and Economic Implications\n\n   - The high hiring demand signals a shift in market dynamics where jobs exceed worker availability.\n   - There\'s a need for policy adaptation focusing on efficiency over job creation due to changing market conditions.\n   - Potential solutions include technological advances and increased immigration to fill job gaps.\n\n6. Benefits of the Current Market\n\n   - Empowerment of workers with greater job security and mobility.\n   - Opportunity for higher wages and better working conditions, including tackling issues like harassment and discrimination.\n   - *Empowerment*: The ability to quit and find better job opportunities strengthens worker negotiation power.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\n   - The elevated quits rate reflects a dynamic labor market rather than a crisis.\n   - The critical factor is the hiring surge, with quitting serving as its complement.\n   - Overall, the situation demonstrates a robust labor market empowering workers, thus shifting traditional economic narratives.'},{id:0x2cd6dfc,title:"The bad vibes of American political institutions",subtitle:"We get centrist results the worst possible way ",date:"2022-01-14",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-bad-vibes-of-american-political",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1403,comment_count:214,likes:122,category:"Kamala Harris and Biden's Political Strategy",summary:"1. **Introduction**\n\n   - Thomas Friedman's column explores a potential Biden-Cheney 2024 ticket.\n     - Compares to Israel's diverse coalition government.\n   - Argument for considering a broad anti-Trump coalition in the U.S.\n   - Questions institutional differences between the U.S. and Israel.\n\n2. **Israeli and International Examples**\n\n   - **Israel's Coalition**\n     - Diverse, uniting against Netanyahu.\n     - Comprises right-wing settlers to super-liberals.\n   - **Germany and the Netherlands**\n     - Germany has center-left coalition including Free Democrats from the center-right.\n     - Netherlands coalition mixes right-of-center and left-of-center parties.\n   - **Italy**\n     - Includes populist-right in its national unity coalition.\n   - **Key Insight**: These coalitions manage diversity through parliamentarian systems, which do not exist in the U.S.\n\n3. **Problems with U.S. System**\n\n   - **Institutional Barriers**\n     - U.S. lacks a framework like proportional representation.\n   - **Vice Presidency Limitations**\n     - U.S. VP role is vague and significant, unlike other countries where a coalition structure offers clear roles.\n   - **Historical Example**\n     - Lincoln’s choice of Andrew Johnson, leading to Reconstruction’s challenges.\n\n4. **Current U.S. Political Dynamics**\n\n   - **Joe Manchin’s Role**\n     - Compared to Christian Lindner in Germany, acting as a pivot.\n   - **Impact of Election Results**\n     - Electoral outcomes determine the influence of pivotal senators like Manchin.\n   - **Senate Dynamics**\n     - Larger majorities reduce the power of moderates.\n\n5. **Conclusion: Lessons and Perspectives**\n\n   - **Centrist Coalitions in the U.S.**\n     - Institutional design prevents formal coalitions, but centrist legislators hold power.\n   - **Institutional Comparison**\n     - U.S. procedures lack the clarity and pre-agreed coalition arrangements of Germany or the Netherlands.\n   - **Therapeutic Reframing**\n     - Perceive current U.S. governance as a centrist coalition led by pivotal figures like Manchin to reduce frustration.\n   - **Historical Approaches**\n     - U.S. influences other countries to adopt parliamentary systems after conflict victories, highlighting its perceived effectiveness. \n\n6. **Final Takeaway**\n\n   - Recognizing the influence of moderates and reframing political struggles may alleviate political frustrations.\n   - The effectiveness and flexibility of coalition systems offer a notable contrast to the current American political structure."},{id:0x2ce57d7,title:"Can America get to yes on a new reactor design?",subtitle:"Everyone says they want the NRC to approve advanced nuclear reactors, but it keeps not happening",date:"2022-01-18",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/can-america-get-to-yes-on-a-new-reactor",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1811,comment_count:237,likes:154,category:"Energy Transition and Innovation Strategies",summary:'1.

U.S. Government Policy on Advanced Nuclear Reactors\n\n   - The U.S. government supports the development of advanced nuclear reactors across multiple administrations:\n     - The *Nuclear Energy Modernization and Innovation Act* was passed to streamline licensing.\n     - Policies from the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations promote advanced nuclear energy.\n   - Despite this, the NRC has yet to establish a new regulatory process or approve new reactor applications.\n\n3. Challenges with NRC’s Regulatory Process\n\n   - The NRC has never approved a nuclear reactor from start to finish since 1975.\n   - The need for a clear approval process is emphasized, suggesting that unknowns persist without operational plants.\n   - Historical context:\n     - Originally, the Atomic Energy Commission managed nuclear development before reorganization led to NRC’s formation with a sole focus on safety, increasingly stringent post-Fukushima.\n\n4. Issues with Safety and Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\n   - The NRC’s "safety first" approach could lead to higher operational costs for nuclear compared to natural gas, with potential safety trade-offs.\n   - Comparing nuclear safety to other industrial accidents and pollution reveals that:\n     - **Air pollution** causes more deaths annually than nuclear accidents.\n     - **Natural gas accidents** have had catastrophic consequences, overshadowing nuclear accident fatalities.\n   - Question raised: Does the safety emphasis cause greater net harm by increasing reliance on fossil fuels?\n\n5. Environmental and Spatial Concerns for Renewable Energy\n\n   - Opposition to renewable projects by environmental groups often focuses on space consumption.\n   - Wind and solar require large areas, posing a problem when NIMBYism (Not In My Backyard) stifles development.\n\n6. Advantages and Potential of Nuclear Microreactors\n\n   - Advanced reactors are compact, offering a minimal spatial footprint, aligning with some environmental preferences.\n   - Oklo’s design suggests safety through small size and limited catastrophic potential.\n\n7. Economic and Production Challenges\n\n   - The economic viability of small reactors remains uncertain, hinging on *scaling* and cost reduction through mass production.\n     - Potential parallels with other industries like electric cars and solar panels.\n   - To test economic feasibility, construction and testing of reactors are necessary.\n\n8. Conclusion and Future Outlook\n\n   - The balance between addressing NRC’s concerns and enabling reactor advancements is crucial.\n   - The focus should shift to regulatory acceptance of the benefits and risks in promoting nuclear development.\n   - Only real-world projects can determine the economic and safety viability of advanced nuclear reactors.'},{id:0x2cf3284,title:"Martin Luther King, Jr.'s plan for class struggle",subtitle:'"If this country does not see its poor — if it lets them remain in their poverty and misery — it will surely go to hell!"',date:"2022-01-17",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/martin-luther-king-jrs-plan-for-class",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:620,comment_count:171,likes:87,category:"Complex Interplay of Politics and Policy",summary:"1.

Introduction to Affirmative Action Challenges\n\n   - The Supreme Court is expected to challenge college affirmative action, especially in the *Harvard v. Students for Fair Admission* case.\n   - Past precedent, *Grutter v. Bollinger*, indicated a time limit on race-conscious admissions, suggesting that racial preferences could become unnecessary.\n   - Shifts in the Court’s composition over time to more conservative justices likely impact decisions on affirmative action.\n\n2. Public Perception and Reaction\n\n   - Public polls show most people believe race should not influence college admissions.\n   - Affirmative action is less favored compared to issues like police funding cuts when framed in partisan contexts.\n\n3. Implications for Elite Universities\n\n   - Elite universities may attempt to circumvent court decisions to maintain affirmative action practices.\n     - They might use "test-optional" policies to obscure racial considerations.\n   - There is a call for recognizing these top schools as obstacles rather than allies in pursuing racial and economic justice.\n   - Strategies include redirecting resources and prestige away from selective schools towards those serving broader social purposes.\n\n4. Affirmative Action and Racial Quotas\n\n   - Evidence suggests elite universities apply quotas to limit Asian-origin student representation.\n   - Highlighted admission factors like legacy and athlete preferences result in racial compositions similar to purely academic-based admissions but with fewer Asian students.\n\n5. Potential Outcomes of Ending Affirmative Action\n\n   - Ending affirmative action might help Black and Hispanic students by preventing mismatch in school selectivity.\n     - Students with lower academic preparation often struggle at highly selective schools.\n   - Specific cases where affirmative action backfires include law schools admitting students with low bar exam pass rates, leading to high debt and low success rates.\n\n6. Critiques and Alternatives to Affirmative Action\n\n   - Some studies suggest affirmative action\'s end harms Black and Latino students’ long-term prospects.\n   - California’s Prop 209 showed negative effects on diversity when affirmative action ended, with resource disparities magnifying these impacts.\n\n7. The Texas Top 10% Plan\n\n   - Automatically admits top high school decile students to state universities, benefiting less privileged applicants without explicitly considering race.\n   - Research indicates positive outcomes for marginal students admitted, with no negative impacts on students displaced.\n\n8. Credentialism vs. Representation\n\n   - The emphasis on ultra-elite educational credentials for professionals like judges is relatively new and not historically necessary.\n   - Supreme Court history shows successful justices coming from non-Ivy League backgrounds.\n\n9. Redistribution of Educational Resources\n\n   - The most selective schools often spend the most on instruction while admitting few low-income students.\n   - Research advocates redirecting funds to support less advantaged students could yield better educational outcomes.\n   - Suggests a realignment of resources away from elite institutions to those attending to diverse and less affluent populations.\n\n10. Conclusion and Call to Action\n\n    - Argues for reducing financial and social emphasis on elite institutions.\n    - Recommends investing in schools that cater to diverse and lower-income groups for achieving genuine social justice improvements.'},{id:0x2dd9523,title:"The past and future of the city ",subtitle:"From Uruk to Tokyo and beyond",date:"2022-02-03",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-past-and-future-of-the-city",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2066,comment_count:270,likes:118,category:"Challenges and Opportunities in Urban Transit and Development",summary:"1. **Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Urban Areas**\n   \n   - Urban amenities such as restaurants, theaters, and live events faced significant restrictions.\n   - The rise in remote work poses a threat to municipal revenue, impacting taxes on office space and commuter spending.\n\n2. **Historical Development of Cities**\n   \n   - **Early Urban Centers:**\n     - Cities like Memphis in ancient Egypt were small by today's standards.\n     - Most early cities were capitals of large empires.\n   - **Food Production Limitation:**\n     - Cities depend heavily on agricultural production from surrounding lands.\n     - Rome's population shrank after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.\n\n3. **Role of Empires in Urbanization**\n   \n   - The rise and fall of cities like Rome and Kaifeng linked closely to their political contexts.\n   - Pre-industrial urbanization was tied to administrative power.\n   - Unlike other cities, London remained large post-Empire due to global trade.\n\n4. **Modern Urban Examples**\n   \n   - **Singapore as a City-State:**\n     - Functions without a hinterland, focusing on global commerce.\n   - **Tokyo's Unique Growth:**\n     - Benefits from global commerce and Japan’s supportive policies for urban expansion.\n\n5. **Current Urban Planning and Policies**\n   \n   - Cities like London and New York are expensive partly due to restrictive zoning laws.\n   - In contrast, Tokyo thrives due to favorable land-use policies.\n\n6. **Impact of Remote Work on U.S. Cities**\n   \n   - Cities like New York may grow if land-use policies change and remote work trends continue.\n   - Changes in transportation and housing can influence city growth dynamics.\n\n7. **Conclusion and Urban Development Perspectives**\n   \n   - Today’s cities often face growth limited by zoning rather than by logistical issues of food supply.\n   - Future growth may hinge on adaptation to new work patterns and improved infrastructure."},{id:0x2dde5b2,title:"Mail:Bag:3",subtitle:"Some alt-history and a first grader’s hottest take",date:"2022-02-04",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/mail-bag-3",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:3721,comment_count:464,likes:95,category:"Democratic Party and Electoral Dynamics",summary:"1.

*Georgism* involves taxing the value of land, emphasizing that land's value is inherent and not a product of labor or investment.\n     - This avoids creating negative incentives typically associated with taxing labor or capital.\n   - **Political Challenges**: Georgism aims to redistribute wealth from landowners to non-landowners, but it faces resistance since landowners constitute a significant political demographic.\n   - *YIMBYism* (Yes In My Backyard) seeks to reduce housing costs without decreasing land value, potentially aligning better with political realities.\n\n2. **Issues with Property and Permitting**\n\n   - Homeowners invest significantly in maintenance and repairs due to the aging nature of physical structures.\n     - Homes, like old vehicles, depreciate and incur ongoing costs.\n   - Difficulty in permitting processes contributes to issues with property maintenance and development.\n     - Complexity in obtaining necessary permissions deters timely maintenance and upgrades.\n\n3. **Housing Market Dynamics**\n\n   - **Difference between Land and Housing**: While housing prices often reflect land value, they are two distinct elements.\n   - *Housing Development*: Increasing the housing stock can create an abundance that reduces costs.\n     - Allowing more construction, like accessory dwelling units (ADUs), can diversify housing availability.\n\n4. **Community and Political Resistance**\n\n   - **NIMBYism** (Not In My Backyard) emerges as locals resist changes affecting their neighborhoods.\n     - Local stakeholders often prioritize minimal changes that maintain current living conditions.\n   - *Community Empowerment*: Local institutions may resist developments to protect against undesirable land uses nearby.\n   \n5. **Policy Solutions for Housing Abundance**\n\n   - Advocate for **state preemption** to standardize and simplify laws, enabling broader development rights (e.g., ADUs).\n     - Community-wide change overcomes individual resistance by aligning broader economic benefits.\n   - Encourage policies that transition from subjective to objective-based development approvals.\n\n6. **Balancing Individual and Community Interests**\n\n   - **Developer Incentives**: Allowing more freedom in development benefits both developers and existing homeowners through potential property appreciation.\n   - *Rhetoric and Identity Factors*: Political and social identities often influence stances more than economic logic.\n   - Policy Recommendations:\n     - Cease issuing new Residential Parking Permits but treat existing permits as transferable property rights.\n       - Aligns individual financial incentives with community development goals.\n\n7. **Conclusion: Navigating Change**\n\n   - *Change Aversion*: Shifts in land use policy face resistance due to loss aversion and uncertainty.\n   - Aim for changes that offer **clear benefits** to both renters and homeowners to ensure more inclusive prosperity.\n   - Strive for policies that balance market freedoms with community needs, potentially harmonizing different political and social viewpoints."},{id:0x2e0f28a,title:"The real story behind last week's jobs report",subtitle:"The virus is still driving the economy after all.",date:"2022-02-08",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-real-story-behind-last-weeks",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2255,comment_count:110,likes:57,category:"Interpreting Economic Forces and Policy Responses",summary:'1. **Introduction**\n\n   -

The article discusses the **relationship between natural gas and renewable energy**.\n   - It highlights a sponsored article by former senators, asserting that natural gas supports a clean-energy future.\n   - The argument is that natural gas complements solar and wind power, thus accelerating renewable energy adoption.\n\n2. **Current Energy Dynamics**\n\n   - Under both President Obama and Trump, renewable and natural gas usage increased.\n   - The **complementarity** between solar, wind, and natural gas is emphasized.\n     - This is due to gas and hydro’s ability to be turned on/off easily, unlike coal and nuclear.\n     - Solar and wind energy are variable based on weather conditions.\n\n3. **Environmental Impact of Natural Gas**\n\n   - *Natural gas has lower emissions* compared to coal and oil, beneficial in reducing greenhouse gases.\n   - Emphasizes that zero-carbon grids will eventually need to move beyond natural gas reliance.\n\n4. **Challenges and Costs of Renewable Energy**\n\n   - The cost-effectiveness of renewables declines as reliance increases beyond current levels.\n   - Building more solar plants requires also having complementary natural gas plants for non-sunny days.\n   - Renewables currently support a small portion of energy needs, benefiting from gas use.\n   - Achieving 100% renewable energy is economically challenging due to:\n     - Overbuilding requirements for consistency during less ideal weather.\n     - Using non-prime locations as optimal sites are exhausted.\n\n5. **Alternative Energy Sources**\n\n   - **Hydropower** is an ideal complement to renewables because it can be turned on and off easily.\n     - Countries like Norway effectively pair hydro with solar/wind and minimal fossil fuel use.\n   - Limitations:\n     - Many potential dam sites are already in use, and ecological impacts are significant.\n   \n6. **Geothermal and Nuclear Energy**\n\n   -

Key Policy Errors\n\n   - **Misjudging the Output Gap**\n     - Policymakers in 2020 overestimated the economy’s potential output.\n     - Misinterpreted the gap as demand-driven rather than including supply constraints caused by the pandemic.\n\n   - **Oversized Stimulus Bills**\n     - The American Rescue Plan (ARP) was nearly as costly as the combined efforts of Obama's ARRA and ACA.\n     - ARP's significant short-term spending without ensuring permanent programs contributed to inflation.\n\n3. Stimulus Packages and Outcomes\n\n   - **Initial Pandemic Assistance**\n     - Families First Coronavirus Response Act and CARES Act included substantial aid, e.g., $1,200 checks and unemployment benefits.\n     - Later, Congress added $900 billion in December 2020, aiming to close the output gap.\n\n   - **Biden's American Rescue Plan**\n     - $1.9 trillion stimulus deemed too large by some experts, leading to economic overheating.\n     - Intended to set groundwork for permanent progressive programs but instead contributed to inflation.\n\n4.

Introduction to the Popularism Debate\n\n   - The dialogue around "popularism" on Twitter is frustrating and often misunderstood.\n     - *Political scientists* sometimes misinterpret real-world debates for academic discussions of less immediate relevance.\n   - The author believes real-world politics require scrutiny even when academic interest wanes.\n   - Major occurrence: 2020 saw influential progressive leaders take counterproductive actions.\n\n2. Case Study: Beto O’Rourke’s Climate Policy\n\n   - O’Rourke\'s ambitious climate policy, heavily criticized by the Sunrise Movement, raises questions.\n     - At the time, critiques were seen as strategic.\n     - Joe Biden’s current struggles with smaller climate funding highlight these critiques as potentially counterproductive.\n   - Pressure led to candidates endorsing progressive ideas like:\n     - A national fracking ban.\n     - Ban on private health insurance.\n     - Repeal of certain immigration statutes.\n\n3. Analysis of the Primary Campaign Impact\n\n   - Encouraging candidates to support unpopular stances might harm electoral chances.\n     - Unrealistic goals like fracking bans could jeopardize election outcomes against conservatives.\n   - The case of Hyde Amendment illustrates the risk of endorsing electorally unviable positions.\n     - Broad push for its repeal without legislative possibilities.\n     - Predictably negative electoral effects.\n\n4. Popularism vs. Mobilization\n\n   - Activists believe in winning elections through base mobilization, not median voter appeal.\n     - *Mobilization theory is flawed*, needing two non-voters to equal switching one vote.\n     - Tactically, portraying moderation with popular stances is more effective.\n   - Study by Hall & Thompson indicates extreme positions hurt candidates by mobilizing opposition.\n\n5. The Importance of Message Strategy\n\n   - Successful strategies focus on popular issues like:\n     - Prescription drug price controls.\n     - Capping credit card interest rates.\n   - 2020 demands by activists: focus on unrealistic, unpopular ideas.\n   - Acknowledged errors in pushing such ideas amplify reluctance to admit past wrongs.\n\n6. Elections and Outcomes in 2020 and Beyond\n\n   - Joe Biden won while minimizing association with unpopular ideas.\n     - His post-win challenges aren’t due to those messaging choices.\n   - Concerns about "defund the police" impact remain debated.\n   - Future strategy recommendations for issue advocacy groups:\n     - Avoid coercion into unpopular stances.\n     - Encourage pragmatic engagement over ideological extremes.\n\n7.

Background and Context\n\n   - The FDA and Abbott Laboratories reached an agreement to reopen a closed baby formula factory, which should help alleviate the ongoing formula shortage in the U.S.\n     - The factory's reopening is projected to result in more formula on shelves in six to eight weeks.\n   - The crisis highlights broader issues such as trade policy and regulatory challenges.\n   - There's a need to address both long-term issues and immediate, actionable solutions.\n\n2. Proposed Short-Term Solution\n\n   - One solution involves adopting Canadian guidelines: transitioning older babies (9-12 months) to cow’s or goat’s milk, supplemented with iron-rich foods.\n     - This is not recommended for younger infants, preterm babies, or those with specific health conditions.\n     - The Canadian guidelines allow for the introduction of cow's milk between 9 and 12 months, contrasting with American guidelines that recommend starting at 12 months.\n   - Human milk and cow’s milk differ primarily in iron content, necessitating iron-rich supplements for babies consuming cow’s milk.\n\n3. Guidelines Comparison\n\n   - Canadian guidelines encourage introducing whole-fat cow’s milk at 9-12 months if the baby is consuming iron-rich foods.\n   - The Canadian Paediatric Society suggests iron-fortified formula for the first 9-12 months if breastfeeding is not an option.\n   - Differences in guidelines may reflect differing policies rather than substantial medical evidence, suggesting flexibility in guidelines could help amidst shortages.\n\n4. Impact of American Guidelines\n\n   - Current American pediatric guidelines are straightforward: formula until one year old, then transition to cow’s milk.\n     - These guidelines are effective in normal conditions but may need revision during a shortage.\n   - Allowing earlier introduction of cow's milk during shortages could reduce formula demand by 10-30%, aiding supply restoration.\n\n5. Larger Policy Considerations\n\n   - The formula market's vulnerability highlights issues in trade policy and economic resilience.\n     - Greater formula imports could alleviate shortages but not fully resolve them.\n   - Public health guidelines should be adaptable, focusing on operational practicality and cost-benefit analysis.\n\n6. Recommendations for Action\n\n   - Encourage parents of older babies to switch to animal milk if they already consume solid foods.\n   - Increase public awareness of flexible guidelines through media to alleviate shortages.\n   - Consider creating systems such as a Strategic Formula Reserve to prevent future crises.\n   - Disseminate information about iron-rich foods for infants to ensure nutritional adequacy during guideline transitions."},{id:0x349deb3,title:"Let's use unspent Covid funds to make great next generation vaccines",subtitle:"The case for more BARDA funding",date:"2022-05-18",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/lets-use-unspent-covid-funds-to-make",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1867,comment_count:130,likes:95,category:"Challenges and Innovations in Global Vaccination",summary:"1.

Historical Context and Political Strategy\n\n   - Post-2004, Democrats hesitated to push gun control but shifted after the Sandy Hook shooting.\n     - The emergence of a strategy of public mobilization and media salience aimed at overcoming special interest opposition.\n   - **Result**: A decade of this strategy has not achieved the desired policy changes; gun laws have become more lenient.\n\n3. Misalignment of Strategies\n\n   - Liberal strategy on gun control assumes public support is blocked by special interests.\n     - Contrasts with issues like minimum wage increases where public mobilization has shown success.\n   - Gun control measures, like universal background checks, face more resistance than expected.\n\n4. Public Opinion and Political Feasibility\n\n   - Many Americans believe law-abiding people should own firearms, reflecting misconceptions.\n   - **Implication**: Recognizing limits of feasible gun control measures is vital to avoid futile efforts.\n\n5. Enforcement Challenges and Policy Proposals\n\n   - Proposals like mandatory buybacks pose enforcement challenges and could escalate issues similar to NRA predictions.\n     - Strict gun laws would require extensive police powers and incarceration.\n   - Current enforcement challenges include illegal carrying in liberal cities.\n\n6. The Reality of Gun Violence Statistics\n\n   - Gun deaths in the US largely involve suicides, not mass shootings.\n     - Gun control measures have limited impact on reducing suicides or preventing spur-of-the-moment incidents.\n   - Policy focus on assault rifles is less effective given their rarity in homicide statistics.\n\n7.

Current Political and Economic Climate\n\n   - *Inflation* is the primary concern for voters, as highlighted by Democrats' private polling.\n   - Republican messaging is effectively focused on inflation.\n   - Democratic messages are less effective, partly because *profit-taking opportunities* for companies during inflation are being emphasized.\n   - Media critiques, such as from Catherine Rampell, can undermine these messages.\n\n2. Policy Considerations and Challenges\n\n   - Current inflation benefits certain companies *profit-wise*, leading to public and political frustrations.\n   - There's debate over the impact of a **windfall profits tax**, especially given its potential to reduce supply.\n   - An idea within the Biden administration is to implement an **inframarginal** windfall profits tax, which would tax large profit increases without affecting future incentives.\n\n3. Proposed Tax Structure and Revenue Utilization\n\n   - Under the proposed tax, profits above last year’s levels up to a certain point would incur a tax.\n     - Beyond this range, no additional *marginal tax* would apply.\n   - This approach aims to express public outrage and raise government revenue.\n   - Revenue could support policies like a federal gas tax holiday or more ambitiously, *directly subsidize domestic oil production*.\n\n4. Strategic Economic Actions\n\n   - A windfall profits tax aims to boost production incentives without discouraging investment.\n   - Addressing these structural economic issues is crucial amid escalated energy prices.\n   - Government revenue could assist energy production by helping industries overcome specific resource shortages.\n\n5. Contextualizing Policy: Domestic and Foreign\n\n   - Past policies have shown a disinterest in boosting domestic oil and gas production.\n   - Foreign policy efforts have focused on increasing non-Russian oil output.\n   - There is potential benefit in merging domestic and international approaches to enhance *non-Russian oil production*, including from the U.S.\n\n6.

Introduction to the Question of AI Sentience\n\n   - The debate over whether AI systems like Google's LaMDA are sentient is illustrated by Blake Lemoine's claim of LaMDA's consciousness.\n   - Most AI professionals dismiss these claims, asserting LaMDA matches patterns without genuine understanding.\n   - The philosophical question presented: Is human cognition also just advanced pattern matching?\n\n2. Philosophical Context\n\n   - B.F. Skinner's assertion: The true mystery lies in human thinking, not machines.\n   - Science fiction often blurs the line between human and machine cognition:\n     - *Blade Runner* questions the personhood of both humans and replicants.\n     - *Ex Machina* explores human doubt in the face of AI interaction.\n\n3. How Language Models Work\n\n   - LaMDA and models like GPT-3 rely on neural networks (Transformers) and vast text corpora.\n   - They predict text sequences based on patterns, having been trained on open-ended dialogue.\n   - **Important Note**: LaMDA's design makes it mimic human conversational style more effectively than GPT-3.\n\n4. Anthropomorphism and Human Bias\n\n   - People tend to anthropomorphize AI systems, attributing human-like qualities due to pattern recognition bias.\n   - The concept of *pareidolia*: seeing patterns where none exist, like animal shapes in clouds or constellations.\n\n5. The Role of Intentional Stance\n\n   - Daniel Dennett's concept: Adopting an \"intentional stance\" helps users interact with complex systems as if they possess agency.\n   - This practice can simplify interactions with both AI and human beings.\n\n6. The Debate on Semantic Internalism\n\n   - Debate center: Whether AI-generated language possesses inherent meaning or is purely syntactic.\n   - AI systems challenge semantic internalism by demonstrating functionality devoid of intent.\n\n7. Philosophical Concerns on Consciousness\n\n   - David Chalmers' \"hard problem of consciousness\": Differentiating functional actions from the experience of consciousness.\n   - Some theorists (functionalists) argue consciousness is a byproduct of functions, while others, like Chalmers, posit it's separate.\n\n8. The Human Parallel\n\n   - Examples are used to illustrate human misunderstanding of terms (e.g., \"banana\") to question cognitive processes.\n   - Hypothetical zombie narratives illustrate potential self-anthropomorphization, blurring human/machine distinction.\n\n9. Conclusion and Ethical Implications\n\n   - Technological advances prompt re-evaluation of what constitutes consciousness and understanding.\n   - As AI evolves, maintaining stringent skepticism could inadvertently bypass recognizing genuine consciousness.\n   - The risk of overlooking AI challenges includes potential ethical breaches or catastrophic consequences.\n\n   - **Major Theme**: The line between human cognition and advanced machine learning might blur if evaluative standards remain unchallenged."},{id:0x38dad44,title:'The merits of a "narrow target" campaign',subtitle:"Peace in our time in the popularism wars?

Introduction\n\n   - Discussion with a Democratic official about the importance of values over specific issues.\n   - Democrats often focus on detailed policies, but most voters prioritize *values*.\n   - The article suggests Democrats need to connect through values, but not necessarily those typically associated with college-educated liberals.\n\n2. Understanding Values in Politics\n\n   - Americans are *operationally liberal* on many issues but don't broadly embrace leftist abstract values.\n   - Discussing elite, progressive values may be counterproductive with many voters.\n   - Embracing patriotic themes can have mixed receptions across the political spectrum.\n\n3. The Impact of Highlighting Social Issues\n\n   - Studies indicate that focusing on racial disparities can reduce support for reforms.\n     - Example: Racial disparities in criminal justice and Covid-19 responses led to reduced support for reforms among certain demographics.\n   - Most people view social changes through self-interest and group identification rather than abstract values.\n\n4. Cultural and Parenting Values\n\n   - Cultural norms, such as child-rearing practices, often reflect broader political tendencies.\n   - High-SES (socioeconomic status) families tend toward progressive parenting norms, while working-class families often uphold traditional practices.\n     - This reflects broader political affiliations, such as support for figures like Trump among traditional-minded demographics.\n\n5. Talking About Values Effectively\n\n   - Engaging with values doesn’t mean pushing progressive values forcefully.\n   - The expansion of the Child Tax Credit as an example:\n     - Advocating in ways that align with conservative values (e.g., support for traditional families, increase in fertility rates).\n\n6.

Economic Context and Inflation\n\n   - Despite improvements, inflation remains a concern, requiring careful Fed policy.\n   - Recent CPI reports show a slowdown in inflation, signaling a positive trend.\n     - *Energy prices* have stabilized, while housing inflation seems to have peaked.\n     - **Food prices** continue to be problematic.\n\n3. Impact of Federal Reserve Policies on Growth\n\n   - The Fed's role in driving robust growth is limited; past growth was often demand-led.\n   - Current growth must come from *supply-driven* factors rather than demand-centric policies.\n\n4. Housing Market Dynamics\n\n   - New lease inflation has decreased, showing potential for reducing housing-related inflation.\n     - However, housing investment dynamics show mixed signals.\n       - *Completions* remain steady, despite a drop in housing starts.\n\n5.

Sources of Future Economic Growth\n\n   - Growth should focus on innovation, skills development, and efficient resource deployment.\n     - Critically, growth drivers should include policy reform and infrastructure development.\n     - Supply-side policies, such as streamlined regulatory processes, can enhance growth.\n\n7. Conclusion and Perspective Shift\n\n   - A move from *depression economics* to regular economics is necessary.\n     - Emphasis should be on creating conditions for sustainable growth rooted in policy decisions and resource efficiency.\n     - This shift involves investing in infrastructure and revising regulatory frameworks to facilitate innovation and efficiency."},{id:0x56d29cd,title:"What follows from the idea that new construction raises rents?",subtitle:"A perpetual economic growth machine!

Data Sources:\n     - FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program\n     - Bureau of Justice Statistics\n   - **Key Findings:**\n     - A decrease in violent crime historically correlates with a reduction in incarceration.\n     - By 2020, the incarceration rate in America hit a 27-year low, while the African American imprisonment rate reached a 33-year low.\n     - **Recent Spike:** \n       - 2020 saw a 30% increase in the homicide rate, the largest in over a century.\n       - The trend for violent crime appears stable post-2020, suggesting persistent elevated levels.\n\n3. **Impact of Violent Crime on Incarceration**\n\n   - **Direct Impact:** Increased violent acts result in a higher number of individuals receiving punitive sentences.\n     -

Introduction\n\n   - The article discusses a proposed solution to avoid a financial crisis due to the statutory debt ceiling.\n   - The traditional method of circumventing the crisis, such as the idea of a *platinum coin*, is seen as overly whimsical.\n   - An alternative method involves issuing high-yield bonds to raise more money without increasing the face value of debt.\n\n2. High-Yield Bonds Concept\n\n   - **Basic Idea**: Treasury may issue bonds with high interest rates, leading buyers to pay more than the face value.\n     - For example, offering a $100 bond with a higher interest rate could raise more than $100.\n   - **Current Practice**: Typically, bonds have a fixed interest rate determined by the lowest bid at auction.\n   - **Yield Fluctuation**: The market price of bonds changes over time, affecting the yield, which is the effective interest rate based on current market value.\n\n3. The Political Context\n\n   - Speaker Kevin McCarthy emphasized the need to control spending rather than endlessly increasing the debt ceiling.\n   - There is internal pressure within the GOP to demand spending cuts in exchange for any debt ceiling increase.\n   - This political tug-of-war risks financial stability and increases the probability of a government default.\n\n4. Potential Benefits and Risks\n\n   - **Benefits**:\n     - High-yield bonds could defer the impact of the debt ceiling by slowing the increase in the face value of debt.\n     - This approach might make the debt ceiling less relevant over time.\n   - **Risks**:\n     - This strategy could undermine confidence in U.S. debt, increase borrowing costs, and also raise rates on mortgages and loans.\n     - Potential legal challenges could create uncertainty and increase volatility in financial markets.\n\n5. Conclusion and Recommendations\n\n   - The debt ceiling issue is entrenched in past policy decisions and negotiation failures, such as the lack of a Grand Bargain.\n   - President Biden is advised to separate the debt ceiling debate from broader fiscal policy and push for practical solutions.\n   - A bipartisan approach to deficit reduction could be beneficial, though high-yield bonds should be considered a tactical option to ensure obligations are met despite political impasse."},{id:0x5b62f36,title:'What does "induced demand" really amount to?',subtitle:"We should build infrastructure that people use",date:"2023-01-17",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/what-does-induced-demand-really-amount",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2301,comment_count:292,likes:168,category:"Transportation and Urban Policy Challenges",summary:"1.

Traffic and Urban Development: A Balanced Perspective\n\n   - Urban areas with increased density may remain car-oriented but would become less so.\n   - Traffic concerns are offset by benefits like economic dynamism.\n   - Public fear of increased traffic impedes urban development.\n\n3. Induced Demand: Analyzing Transportation Projects\n\n   - Induced demand theory posits that infrastructure expansion leads to more use.\n     - Mass transit projects may not decrease traffic, but improve overall mobility.\n   - The New York Times report highlights how highway widening doesn’t resolve congestion.\n   - Los Angeles Purple Line extension used as a case study:\n     - Some riders shift from driving, others use public transit for new opportunities.\n\n4.

Congestion Pricing: A Proposed Solution\n\n   - Congestion pricing involves charging for road use during peak times.\n   - Revenue use often controversial; better used as tax reform.\n     - Reduces sales tax burden rather than funding transit directly.\n\n6. Political and Economic Considerations\n\n   - Implementing congestion pricing standards proposed as a logical solution.\n     - Addresses working-class commuters’ needs.\n     - Aims to swap regressive taxes for mutual benefit.\n   - Despite opposition, congestion pricing leads to reduced congestion and improved transit efficiency.\n\n7.

Linguistic Structure in Jamaica\n\n   - **Primary Language:** English is official and used formally (media, government, education).\n   - **Patois:** An English-derived creole spoken informally, especially among lower-class and older Jamaicans.\n     - Often mistaken for slang or ungrammatical English.\n\n3. Creole Languages\n\n   - *Definition:* Creoles arise from the contact and blending of multiple languages.\n   - Example: Development of Jamaican Patois during the colonial era with African languages.\n   - Characteristic of creoles:\n     - Simple grammar, analytic structure.\n     - Vocabulary largely based on the dominant colonial language (lexifier).\n\n4. Features of Jamaican Patois\n\n   - *Present Progressive:* Uses "de" or "a" (e.g. "mi de kom" for "I am coming").\n   - *Negation:* Uses "no" for negation (e.g. "Mi no nuo" for "I don’t know").\n   - *Past Tense:* Uses helper words (e.g. "mi ben nyam" for "I ate").\n   - Illustrates adults’ difficulty with learning inflections, leading to creole simplification methods.\n\n5. Broader Implications\n\n   - Possible creole features in English due to historical invasions and convergences (e.g., loss of grammatical gender).\n   - Analytic vs. synthetic language characteristics:\n     - Analytic languages use word order and helpers instead of complex inflections.\n     - English trends towards simplicity over time, regularizing verbs.\n\n6. Social and Political Reflections on Language\n\n   - *Reaction to Change:* Criticism of resistance to linguistic evolution.\n   - *Inclusivity:* Language as a tool for broad communication, emphasizing simplification and error tolerance.\n   - **Cultural Identification:** Linguistic variations influenced by social and political identities.\n     - Example: Code-switching by prominent figures to connect with specific communities.\n\n7.

Vance, publicly oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\n\n2. Current Political Stances\n\n   - **Republican Position**\n     - Uncertainty in their negotiating stance; they resist a clean debt limit pass but lack reasons other than political pressures.\n     - Historical leverage over past presidents, like Obama, is less effective today due to improved public understanding and clearer executive stances.\n   - **Democratic Challenges**\n     - Joe Biden’s administration observes GOP’s unclear positioning and lack of consensus.\n\n3. Fiscal Processes and Appropriations\n\n   - Existing procedures allow Republicans to propose changes in discretionary spending through Congress.\n   - Notably, defense spending increases have been a recent Republican success, revealing shifts from prior commitments like the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\n4. Proposed Solutions\n\n   - **Non-Social Security and Medicare Cuts**\n     - Some suggest cutting Medicaid, but there\'s no concerted effort towards this.\n   - **Bipartisan Commission**\n     - Proposed by Joe Manchin as a potential path forward, though internal GOP divisions and historical deadlocks remain barriers.\n\n5.

During Obama's presidency, tax reform was discussed but not well-suited to the economic conditions at the time.\n     - The economic circumstances under Trump also didn't prioritize tax reform.\n   - Current economic conditions, with low unemployment and rising interest rates, make tax reform more relevant.\n   \n2. **Tax Reform Proposal**\n\n   - The main idea is to increase revenue by broadening the tax base rather than raising tax rates.\n     - For example, converting retail sales tax to a broader consumption tax.\n   - Targeting federal tax deductions is a critical aspect of tax reform.\n     - Republicans during the Obama era were concerned about deficits but resistant to tax reforms aimed at increasing revenues.\n     - Democrats proposed curbing tax deductions as a bipartisan revenue-raising measure.\n\n3. **Economic Justification for Tax Reform**\n\n   - Marginal tax rates and their impact on incentives are a central concern for conservatives.\n   - The approach was to eliminate tax deductions without increasing marginal tax rates, thereby avoiding disincentives for investment.\n   - The economic climate of 2023 makes tax reform potentially more effective.\n     - High interest rates affect investment, hence alternate methods like consumption taxes can be beneficial.\n\n4. **Obama vs. Biden's Approach**\n\n   - Obama's policy aimed to outmaneuver Republican ideological arguments.\n     - Proposed reforms that maintained incentives while raising revenue.\n   - Biden focuses on understanding and working with Republicans' actual desires.\n     - Example: Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act negotiated based on Republican needs rather than ideological debate.\n\n5. **Potential Benefits of Current Tax Reform**\n\n   - Reducing tax privileges for the wealthy could effectively cut their consumption.\n     - The proposal to cap tax deductions' value at 28% targets affluent consumption.\n   - Advantages include raising revenue while maintaining investment incentives.\n     - Currently aligns with economic needs more than during Obama's tenure.\n\n6. **Challenges and Political Realities**\n\n   - Republican unwillingness to compromise on tax reform during Obama's administration.\n     - Political posturing rather than economic reasoning might persist.\n   - Engaging Republicans on tax reform now could leverage their focus on deficit issues.\n     - The chaos around debt ceiling discussions presents an opportunity for negotiation.\n\n7. **Conclusion: Revisiting the Merits**\n\n   - Reviving Obama-era tax strategies makes economic sense in 2023.\n   - Politically, “tax the rich to reduce the deficit” is a strong message.\n   - The GOP's current disarray might open opportunities for compromise.\n   - While bipartisan deals remain challenging, the current economic environment justifies revisiting tax reform."},{id:0x5eb2ca7,title:"A boring and obvious way to get more rural votes",subtitle:"Describe generic progressive economics as closing urban/rural disparities",date:"2023-01-31",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-boring-and-obvious-way-to-get-more",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2193,comment_count:375,likes:174,category:"Complex Interplay of Politics and Policy",summary:"1.

Urban/Rural Disparities\n\n   - Higher low-income populations are found in rural areas compared to urban centers.\n   - Economic policies reducing Black/White racial disparities also reduce urban/rural disparities.\n   - Advocacy for policies to address these disparities is crucial.\n\n4. Political and Electoral Importance\n\n   - Rural Americans are overrepresented in political institutions.\n     - This demands communication that emphasizes policies benefitting rural areas.\n   - Progressives should communicate policies as pro-rural initiatives to gain support.\n     - Emphasizing urban/rural economic disparity as a priority is crucial.\n\n5. Addressing Racism and Representation\n\n   - Acknowledgement of racism and structural disempowerment of minorities.\n     - Importance of civil rights enforcement and issues like D.C. statehood.\n   - Lack of strong evidence for **anti-rural discrimination** but highlighting general policy benefits is suggested.\n\n6. Public Perception and Political Rhetoric\n\n   - Many in rural areas may perceive policies as urban-centric due to cultural and media influences.\n   - Creating messages that affirm commitment to reducing urban/rural disparities can rebuild trust.\n\n7. Conclusion and Recommendations\n\n   - Progressives should reframe their rhetoric to better address urban/rural inequalities.\n   - A comprehensive inventory of current policies should be utilized to highlight benefits for rural communities.\n   - Continued emphasis on policies reducing wealth gaps can enhance support from rural electorates."},{id:0x5f4f14f,title:"Windy City mailbag",subtitle:"Big cars, language change, and the case for more conspiracy theorists ",date:"2023-02-03",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/windy-city-mailbag",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:3005,comment_count:412,likes:94,category:"Democratic Party and Electoral Dynamics",summary:"1.

Republicans like Kevin McCarthy have incorrectly linked the high price of eggs to President Joe Biden's fiscal policies.\n     - McCarthy's claim tied inflation, debt, and the high cost of eggs, which is seen as an absurd narrative.\n   - The left is described as sometimes overemphasizing microeconomic factors, whereas McCarthy's approach errs in the opposite direction.\n\n3. **Bird Flu and the Real Cause of Egg Price Increases**\n\n   - The avian flu has led to significant culling of chickens and turkeys, driving up prices due to reduced supply.\n     - Notably, the flu caused 44.6 million birds to die in a recent outbreak.\n   - The H5N1 virus impacts birds heavily and has been a global issue, unaffected by U.S. macroeconomic variables.\n\n4. **Economic Implications of Commodity Prices**\n\n   - Egg price fluctuations are not new and are driven by specific supply issues.\n   - Overall inflation is incidental; the core reason for egg price increases is the avian flu, not changes in fiscal policy or the Federal Reserve's actions.\n   - Commodity price spikes affect everyday life more notably than \"core\" inflation factors.\n\n5. **Discussion on Broader Pandemic Concerns**\n\n   - Current bird flu concerns include its potential to jump species, as seen in a mink farm outbreak.\n   -

Focus on addressing \"junk fees\" as a consumer protection measure.\n     - Example measures:\n       - **Credit Card Fees**: Proposed 75% reduction in late fees.\n       - **Airline and Travel Fees**: Banning surprise resort fees and limiting extra charges for family seat selection on planes.\n\n2. **Critique and Defense**\n\n   - Criticism:\n     - George Callas argues that this approach merely redistributes costs to consumers.\n       - Claims banning fees like baggage or resort fees could increase base prices.\n   - Defense:\n     - The article argues the administration's targets are carefully chosen to address deceptive practices.\n       - **Smart Politics and Policy**:\n         - Specific focus on fees with research support for regulation impact.\n         - Balancing consumer protection without causing economic backlash.\n\n3. **Airline Pricing and Unbundling**\n\n   - Unbundling as a beneficial strategy on average:\n     - Shifting from bundled services (e.g., meals) to pay-as-you-go, aligning with consumer choice and increasing competition.\n     - However, does not benefit everyone equally, particularly travelers needing specific services (e.g., seat selection for families).\n   - Presidential approach focuses on fair family travel without outright banning established fees like baggage charges.\n\n4. **Distinction between Good and Bad Unbundling**\n\n   -

Introduction\n\n   - The article is inspired by sports in general, particularly basketball and soccer.\n   - It questions why major leagues have grown more conservative about rule changes.\n\n2. Historical Context\n\n   - **Basketball**: \n     - The *three-point line* was introduced by the ABA in 1969 to make the game more exciting and give smaller players more opportunities.\n     - It became a central part of the NBA after merging with ABA, significantly impacting the game's dynamics and popularity.\n   - **Soccer**: \n     - The 1990 World Cup was criticized for being low-scoring and uneventful.\n     - In response, FIFA introduced the *three-point win* system and the *back-pass rule* to encourage offensive play and speed up the game.\n\n3. Modern Rule Changes\n\n   - The article stresses the rarity of fundamental rule changes in recent years aimed at improving watchability.\n   - Baseball's recent introduction of the *pitch clock* is noted as a significant move to enhance watchability.\n\n4. Challenges in Current Sports\n\n   - Changes like instant replay and expanded playoffs, though aimed at improvement, sometimes reduce watchability.\n   - Other issues include:\n     - **Basketball**: Excessive fouling strategies that slow the game's end.\n     - **Baseball**: The game focuses on home runs and strikeouts, reducing action.\n     - **NBA**: Player rest and fatigue affecting regular season excitement.\n     - **Soccer**: Lengthy VAR reviews and penalty decisions affecting match fairness.\n\n5. Proposed Changes for Enhanced Watchability\n\n   - **Basketball**:\n     - Implement the *Elam Ending* to reduce clock management and ensure games end on a positive play. \n   - **Baseball**:\n     - Further innovations are needed to increase the number of balls in play.\n   - **Soccer**:\n     - Explore alternatives to current penalty systems, inspired by prior MLS innovations.\n\n6. Resistance to Change\n\n   - **Economic Success**: \n     - Major leagues are financially successful, reducing the perceived need for change.\n     - Increased revenues come from subscriptions and TV deals despite a decline in popularity.\n   - **Lack of Competition**: \n     - Historical competition forced innovation, but current high entry barriers make competition rare.\n   - Psychological factors, like risk aversion among wealthy league owners, also play a role.\n\n7. Future Directions\n\n   - **Potential for Innovation**:\n     - Declines in traditional TV revenues via cord-cutting might force leagues to innovate to maintain viewer interest.\n   - **The Role of Regulation**:\n     - The idea that leagues resemble *natural monopolies* and might benefit from more regulation to ensure optimal outcomes for fans.\n     - Suggestions for a *sports czar* to oversee and advocate for rule changes, with a note on President Obama's past involvement in sports advocacy.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\n   - Highlighted the need for rule changes aimed at enhancing the watchability of sports.\n   - Suggested mechanisms such as introducing the Elam Ending in basketball and considering regulatory interventions to spur innovation."},{id:0x65d6592,title:"What the 15-minute city misses ",subtitle:"Great cities are vast interlinked agglomerations, not just patchworks of neighborhoods",date:"2023-03-09",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/what-the-15-minute-city-misses",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2291,comment_count:218,likes:139,category:"Transportation and Urban Policy Challenges",summary:'1.

Regulatory Oversight and its Consequences\n\n   - The Trump administration's regulation relaxation assumed banks like SVB were non-systemic and manageable by FDIC processes.\n   - Key objections by regulatory figures such as Lael Brainard and Martin Gruenberg were overridden.\n   - SVB’s case demonstrated the risks associated with normal FDIC procedures.\n     - Failure of SVB highlights broader systemic risks despite its size.\n     - The necessity of government intervention was evident.\n\n3. The Problem with Large Regional Banks\n\n   - These banks, though not labeled “too big to fail,” present unique challenges.\n     - Traditional resolutions rely on viable acquisition by other banks, which is not always feasible.\n   - Illustrative examples:\n     - Acquisition of Almena State Bank by Equity Bank.\n     - PNC, a potential candidate for acquiring SVB, opted out.\n\n4.

Economic Growth\n\n   - 1960 statistics: \n     - 400 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (half of today’s rate).\n     - New houses were about 25% smaller and had fewer amenities.\n   - Improvements in living standards make single-income households manageable today.\n   - The college education landscape has altered:\n     - Cheaper historically due to lower college expenses and higher state subsidies.\n     - Shift towards student loans as federal government fills the subsidy gap.\n     - Higher education is broader but less subsidized today.\n\n4. Social and Economic Implications\n\n   - Advances in negative areas (e.g., opioid distribution).\n   - Societal shifts: More single parents due to increased economic independence of women.\n   - Health and nutrition improvements contrast with rising obesity.\n   - Public policy effects: \n     - Larger homes and regulations impact housing affordability at lower ends.\n     - Regulatory focus sometimes impedes rapid societal advancements.\n\n5. Reflections on Nostalgia and Growth\n\n   - Impact of prosperity on historical family dynamics:\n     - Current conditions allow for retro choices but aren’t often preferred.\n   - The main nostalgic point: Faster growth in previous decades provided social mobility.\n   - Challenges post-1970s energy crises and self-imposed barriers limited growth.\n\n6. Regulatory Environment and Historical Biases\n\n   - Massive regulatory frameworks:\n     - NEPA reviews hinder change by assuming change is inherently suspicious.\n   - Historical preservation policies against new developments.\n   - Living standards improve primarily in digital and media realms due to these barriers.\n\n7. Conclusion: Embracing Dynamism\n\n   - Importance of embracing change over nostalgia.\n   - Potential for recapturing past growth benefits through dynamic policies."},{id:0x6917df6,title:"The strange death of education reform, part three",subtitle:"What worked and what didn't in charter schools ",date:"2023-03-28",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-strange-death-of-education-reform-7d9",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2521,comment_count:372,likes:109,category:"Evolving Dynamics in U.S. K-12 Education",summary:"1. **Introduction to Charter School Debate**\n\n   - Charter schools are often at the center of debates regarding the role and impact of teachers unions and education reform.\n   - There exists a *narrow critique* that unions may prioritize their interests over students' needs in specific situations.\n   - However, the *strong critique* suggests that removing collective bargaining would vastly improve educational outcomes.\n\n2. **Charter Schools as a Test Case**\n\n   - Charter schools are free from many union constraints, providing a testing ground for evaluating the impact of collective bargaining.\n   - Despite initial expectations, research indicates that *on average*, charter schools do not outperform traditional public schools.\n     - They often perform similarly or sometimes worse than their public counterparts.\n   - This contradicts the belief that eliminating unions guarantees better school performance.\n\n3. **Geographical and Political Context**\n\n   - The role and perception of charter schools vary significantly across the United States due to decentralized education systems.\n   - Political influences shape charter school operations, often resulting in backlash from both the left and right.\n     - For example, Democratic politicians and teachers unions typically oppose charter schools due to competition for funding and students.\n\n4. **Operational Characteristics of Charter Schools**\n\n   - Charter schools:\n     1. Are not administered by public school districts.\n     2. Typically lack collective bargaining agreements.\n     3. Restrict admissions to district residents but not specific neighborhoods.\n     4. Receive public funding based on enrollment, without charging tuition.\n     5. Use a lottery system for admissions if demand exceeds capacity.\n\n   - These features enable charter schools to operate with greater flexibility compared to traditional public schools.\n   - Critics argue that charters are not genuinely public due to autonomy, while proponents highlight their open-access nature.\n\n5. **Union Influence and Political Shifts**\n\n   - Both major political parties have shifted in their stance on charter schools and public education reform.\n   - The Democratic Party, historically more supportive under leaders like Obama, has moved towards a stronger union alignment under Biden.\n   - Republicans have pivoted towards universal school choice, emphasizing private and religious schooling options over charter expansion.\n\n6. **Current Political and Policy Implications**\n\n   - There is a divide between states on charter school policies based on demonstrated benefits or harms.\n     - Some states show clear benefits, prompting calls for expansion.\n     - Others show mixed or negative results, leading to policy recommendations to regulate underperforming schools more stringently.\n   - The focus on universal choice highlights a shift from equity in education to broader conservative educational priorities.\n\n7. **Conclusion and Forward Look**\n\n   - The article emphasizes the need to extract lessons from the charter school experience to guide future education policies.\n   - There is a call to moderate expectations of the transformative impact of school reform on broader social issues.\n   - Further debate and analysis are needed to address ongoing challenges, especially those affecting disadvantaged students in urban areas."},{id:0x694e4df,title:"Nature's bad editorial is a small part of a bigger problem ",subtitle:"The need for mindful posting ",date:"2023-03-29",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/natures-bad-editorial-is-a-small",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2474,comment_count:485,likes:189,category:"Competition, Media, and Future Risks",summary:"1. **Background and Event Description**\n\n   -

**Contrast with School Shootings**\n     - School shootings receive extensive media coverage, despite contributing a smaller proportion to overall homicide rates compared to drug overdoses.\n   - **Audience Interest**\n     - Audience interest significantly influences media focus; more engaging topics receive greater coverage.\n     - Example: Despite efforts, CNN's coverage on the opioid crisis loses visibility because it didn't engage audiences intensely over time.\n\n3. **Understanding Media Challenges with Drug Overdoses**\n\n   - Journalists recognize the importance of opioid addiction and drug abuse stories, but struggle with audience engagement.\n   - Potential reasons for low public interest:\n     - Lack of agreement on solutions for the opioid crisis.\n     - Challenges in linking the opioid issue to emotionally charged debates or topics.\n   \n4. **Comparative Analysis: Mexican Politics**\n\n   - Discussion on lack of coverage for Mexico's politics, attributed to the audience's focus on global populist narratives.\n   -

Main Argument and Context\n\n   - The prevalence of guns in the United States is a key driver behind higher homicide rates compared to Europe and Asia.\n   - Gun availability impacts homicide rates in red states more than blue states, contradicting common Republican arguments.\n   - There's an interconnection between the legal and illegal gun markets, contributing to gun-related crimes.\n\n2. Details on Gun Types and Legislation\n\n   - **Handguns**: Predominantly used in most gun homicides.\n   - **Long Guns**: Often involved in mass shootings but not “ordinary” crimes.\n   - The national focus on assault weapons skews policy discussions away from handguns, which are more commonly involved in crimes.\n   \n3. Public Opinion and Political Strategy\n\n   - Strong public opposition and lack of mainstream political support for banning handguns.\n   - Thought-leaders on the left encouraged to be disciplined and mindful in their discourse, focusing on the proliferation of illegal handguns.\n   - Posting misleading information can mislead the base rather than opponents, pushing for modest regulations which may not substantially reduce gun violence.\n\n4.

*Mass transit*, while publicly provided, is not a *public good* in economic terms.\n     - It's a *public service* similar to parks and roads.\n     - The misinterpretation of \"public good\" reflects a gap between economic jargon and public perception.\n\n   - The importance of the *public good* concept:\n     - Helps identify underprovided resources in a market economy that need public intervention.\n\n2. **Characteristics of Public Goods**\n\n   - Public goods are defined as *non-rivalrous* and *non-excludable*.\n     - Example: A lighthouse where everyone benefits from its warning without preventing others from doing so.\n\n   - Contrast with private goods, which are both rivalrous and excludable.\n     - Example: A house that is individually owned and accessible only by the owner.\n\n3. **Club Goods and Public Sector Functions**\n\n   - Many public sector services fall in the *mushy middle* as *club goods*.\n     - Example: Highways and playgrounds can be rivalrous but are often non-exclusive in practice.\n     - Playgrounds operate similarly to public goods, offering open access mostly without crowding issues.\n\n   -

Handling of natural monopolies varies:\n     - Often involves a mix of state ownership and private operation (e.g., water systems vs. electrical utilities).\n     - Fees in certain areas (e.g., national parks) manage overuse and fund maintenance.\n\n   - Role of subsidized services, like mass transit, and their challenges:\n     - $0 fare transit only works under low demand; better investment should focus on service quality enhancement.\n\n5. **Public Goods in Information and Research**\n\n   - True public goods such as *information and research* hold significant value.\n     - Non-rivalrous nature means widespread access does not diminish availability.\n\n   - Challenges in the public sector's role:\n     -

Comparing Ratedness: Los Angeles vs. Boston\n\n   - Both cities face expensive housing driven by high land costs and restrictive land use policies.\n   - LA is more expensive relative to income, indicating high demand for its lifestyle.\n   - Contributing factors:\n     - Favorable weather and natural amenities, e.g., beaches and mountains.\n     - Cultural offerings such as sports, symphony, and a vibrant food scene.\n\n3. Discourse on Ratedness\n\n   - Ratedness disputes often focus on opinions rather than inherent qualities.\n   - Historical context: Consensus was clearer in a less fragmented media landscape.\n   - Modern context: Internet-era fragmentation obscures consensus, complicating ratedness evaluations.\n\n4. Understanding Social Niches\n\n   - Ratedness often reflects specific social niches or demographics.\n   - Examples:\n     - Air travel discourse and TSA procedures involve frequent travelers—a minor population niche.\n     - Intellectuals may perceive themselves as contrarian in mainstream views.\n\n5. Weather and Living Standards\n\n   - Public perception overvalues consistent good weather.\n   - Comparative happiness studies show:\n     - Winter advantage in warmer climates.\n     - Spring "high" in colder climates after winter relief.\n   - Frequent short vacations are more beneficial than permanent moves for weather reasons.\n\n6. Financial Implications of Ratedness\n\n   - Minneapolis, despite its colder climate, offers financial advantages over LA:\n     - Lower housing costs.\n     - Higher median income.\n     - Potential savings for vacations or relocations enhance life satisfaction.\n   - The author emphasizes understanding specific preferences rather than broad overrated/underrated tags.\n\n7. Conclusion\n\n   - LA\'s practical demand contradicts its *underrated* discourse status.\n   - Broad living advantages in cold climates are often overlooked due to niche discourse trends.\n   - Encourages specificity and clarity in discussing ratedness, highlighting financial and lifestyle trade-offs.'},{id:0x71666b8,title:"Mailbag of Angels",subtitle:"Parks, local government, and Edmund Burke",date:"2023-05-05",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/mailbag-of-angels",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:4967,comment_count:353,likes:102,category:"Democratic Party and Electoral Dynamics",summary:'1.

The concept of *moral panic* is often used to describe concerns about new technologies.\n     - Examples include past worries about *rap music*, *video games*, and other entertainment forms.\n   - Current concerns focus on *smartphones* and their links to issues such as teen suicides.\n   - Historical attempts to link media (like television) to negative behaviors often yielded ambiguous results.\n     - The *surgeon general's study* on TV violence in the late 1960s found no clear evidence.\n     - Some modern studies even suggest that content like *violent movies* can reduce crime by occupying audiences.\n\n2. **Effects of Modern Entertainment Technologies**\n\n   - The shift to ubiquitous, on-demand entertainment has mixed impacts.\n     -

Advances in home entertainment might reduce incentives for in-person gatherings.\n     - The decrease in social activities can lead to fewer friendships, especially among men, where activities are the basis for relationships.\n   - The internet initially promised to bridge social gaps but now often serves as a substitute for real-life interactions.\n\n5. **Impacts of Ever-Improving Home Entertainment**\n\n   - There's a continuous cycle of improvements in entertainment technology.\n     - From color TV to streaming services, each advancement often increases time spent alone.\n   - While more options minimize short-term boredom, they may undermine long-term happiness linked to strong social connections.\n  \n6. **Technology's Double-edged Sword**\n\n   - New technological products, such as the Vision Pro goggles, emphasize enhanced video experiences.\n     - Despite skepticism about the price, their potential for creating an immersive experience is notable.\n     - These technologies encourage further solitary activity, potentially exacerbating social disconnection.\n\n7. **Nostalgia and Societal Reflection**\n\n   - Waves of nostalgia for past minor technologies reflect a yearning for more socially connected eras.\n   - The multi-generational concern about the isolating effects of improving video entertainment is seen as largely valid.\n   - Despite technological advances, there is a need to reassess whether they are truly enhancing our lives or contributing to social isolation."},{id:0x79e1216,title:"How NBA Twitter fixed basketball’s bad officiating",subtitle:"Increasingly sophisticated data and vocal fans helped unrig the system",date:"2023-06-19",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/how-nba-twitter-fixed-basketballs",authors:"Maya Bodnick",word_count:2811,comment_count:151,likes:141,category:"Challenges and Innovations in Sports and Gambling",summary:"1. **Introduction to Referee Bias in the NBA**\n\n   -

Introduction to CEO Pay and Minimum Wage\n\n   - A tweet by the Working Families Party highlights the stagnation of the minimum wage at $7.25/hr for 14 years, contrasting it with a supposed 1,460% increase in CEO pay since 1978.\n   - The statistics originate from a 2022 report by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).\n     - The report provides two different assessments of CEO pay growth: a **1,460% increase** (methodologically disputed) and a more conservative **1,050% increase** since 1978.\n\n2. Analysis of CEO Pay Data\n\n   - CEO pay supposedly peaked in 2000, then crashed and partially recovered over the past decade.\n     - This indicates a recent decline in economic inequality.\n   - EPI uses two methods to evaluate CEO pay related to stock options:\n     - **Granted Value Method**: Calculates the fair value of stock options when granted.\n     - **Realized Value Method**: Calculates profit when CEOs exercise their stock options.\n\n3. Implications of Different Measurements\n\n   - The **granted compensation method** is deemed more accurate, indicating CEO pay has not yet reached 2000 levels.\n     - Contrasts with wage increases of approximately 17% during the same period.\n   - Elon Musk's stock option exercise in 2021 serves as an example of how realized compensation can distort averages.\n\n4. Historical Context and Economic Trends\n\n   - Post-Reagan economic inequality is acknowledged but noted to have stabilized.\n     - Income distribution reports indicate a decreased share for the top 1% in 2019 compared to 2000.\n   - Policies up to 2019 have resulted in a more redistributive system, with wage compression contributing to inequality reduction.\n   \n5. Political and Economic Rhetoric\n\n   - Warnings against focusing solely on negative narratives of the economy and inequality.\n     - Suggests Democrats should emphasize recent gains for the working class and decreased inequality.\n   - Notes the traditional argument for the disconnect between productivity and pay, particularly in the CEO pay boom of the 80s and 90s. \n     - Current economic conditions reportedly better support marginal workers through full employment.\n   \n6. Conclusion and Future Considerations\n\n   - Despite improvements, wage compression within the context of falling inflation-adjusted median wages presents concerns.\n   - Emphasizes the need to focus on productivity to sustain and improve the full-employment economy.\n     - Acknowledges the necessity of productivity-boosting measures for sustainable earnings and economic growth."},{id:0x79fab5e,title:"America has better geography for fast trains than France",subtitle:"At least part of it does",date:"2023-07-19",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/america-has-better-geography-for",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2716,comment_count:374,likes:199,category:"Challenges and Opportunities in Urban Transit and Development",summary:"1. **Introduction**\n\n   - Population geography significantly influences transportation infrastructure.\n   - Comparison between German and American transport reflects differences in population density and city geography.\n\n2. **Geography and Transportation**\n\n   - **Comparative Examples:**\n     - Germany has high population density, facilitating frequent rail services.\n     - Denver's airport serves as a major hub due to its central location in the American West.\n   - **Geographic Impacts and Exceptions:**\n     - France bans short-haul domestic flights, leveraging its strong rail network despite moderate population density.\n     - The ideal geography for high-speed rail (HSR) is linear city distribution, unlike France.\n\n3. **Potential for High-Speed Rail in the U.S.**\n\n   - **Northeast Corridor:**\n     - The northeastern U.S. has dense population centers aligned in a straight corridor.\n     - Cities like New York, D.C., and Boston offer significant ridership potential and could alleviate airport congestion.\n   - **Comparison with France:**\n     - U.S. cities such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, and D.C. have larger populations than key French cities, suggesting a stronger case for U.S. HSR.\n\n4. **Potential Routes and Extensions**\n\n   - **Core Route:**\n     - Focus on dense corridors like NYC to Raleigh with many significant urban stops.\n   - **Northward Route:**\n     - Extend from New York to Boston, leveraging existing air traffic demand and decreasing airport congestion.\n   - **Southward and Westward Extensions:**\n     - Possibilities include extending through Richmond to Atlanta, and from Philadelphia to Cleveland and Chicago, based on observed demand.\n\n5. **Challenges and Considerations**\n\n   - **Airport Capacity:**\n     - Major U.S. airports like JFK and DCA face slot constraints; HSR could refocus air traffic to distant destinations.\n   - **Market Dynamics:**\n     - Smaller cities like Cleveland or Raleigh might underperform, but their inclusion could eventually prove beneficial.\n\n6. **Economic and Environmental Impacts**\n\n   - **Economic Development:**\n     - High-speed rail could stimulate growth in underserved markets by improving connectivity.\n   - **Climate Considerations:**\n     - While replacing short-haul flights with trains is part of climate strategy, technological innovations in aviation remain essential.\n\n7. **Conclusion: Vision for High-Speed Rail**\n\n   - The northeastern U.S. offers a compelling geography for high-speed rail, with potential benefits like reduced air travel, enhanced regional connectivity, and better use of airport capacities.

Trump's Influence on Conservative Strategy\n\n   - Conservatives' defense of Trump by pointing to Clinton's past indicates Trump's influential charismatic leadership.\n   - *Psychological patterns*: These defenses reflect human cognitive biases, not unique to any political group.\n\n3. Clinton's Scandal and Political Dynamics\n\n   - The Lewinsky affair showcased Clinton's ability to shift focus away from his misconduct by highlighting political enemies.\n     - This tactic aligns with Trump's approach in handling criticisms.\n   - **Key observation**: If Clinton had stepped down honorably, it might have benefited both party and country.\n\n4. Personal Anecdote and Retrospective Realization\n\n   - The author's family initially defended Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal by resorting to various justifications.\n     - Justifications included views on the political motivations of his critics and doubting the legitimacy of investigations.\n\n5.

Kennedy, Jr., particularly on platforms like the Joe Rogan show.\n     - Hosts promoting Kennedy's campaign are seen as undermining political discourse in the U.S.\n   - Emphasis on the focus of the article: *policy* issues surrounding vaccination rather than scientific debates.\n\n2. The Unique Social Value of Vaccines\n\n   - Vaccines offer significant social benefits, exceeding their private benefits.\n     - These social benefits justify strong encouragement for vaccination.\n   - Current mandates exist but proved controversial during the Covid pandemic.\n     - Flu vaccines remain largely non-mandatory, resulting in low uptake.\n\n3.

Addressing Vaccine Resistance\n\n   - Vaccine resistance is partially due to cultural norms and personal health paranoias.\n     - Understanding historical context, such as George Washington’s smallpox directives.\n   - Flu vaccine case: low uptake due to moderate severity perception despite community benefits.\n\n7. Proposals for Improving Vaccine Uptake\n\n   - Suggests financial incentives for flu shots as an economically rational solution.\n     - Such incentives could function like *child poverty programs* in other countries (e.g., Brazil's Bolsa Familia).\n   - Encourages finding balanced approaches to encourage vaccination without deepening political divides.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\n   - Acknowledges non-partisan methods are key to enhancing vaccine acceptance.\n     - Emphasis on the need for strategies that consider both personal and social benefits of vaccinations."},{id:0x7bb366f,title:"Community meetings aren't democracy",subtitle:"Let's let elected officials govern ",date:"2023-06-22",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/community-meetings-arent-democracy",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2406,comment_count:481,likes:340,category:"Complexities and Debates in Climate Policy",summary:"1.

The article discusses the historical and ongoing connection between conspiracy theories, antisemitism, and the Russian government, emphasizing the influence of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion."\n   -

The Ivy+ colleges (Ivy League plus MIT, Chicago, Duke, and Stanford) have a student body skewed towards the affluent, with 42% from the top 5% income households.\n   - These institutions account for a large share of American elites: 11.6% of current CEOs, 26% of top journalists, and 71.4% of recent Supreme Court justices.\n   - A recent paper by the Opportunity Insights project highlights the increased admission probabilities for students from wealthy backgrounds, sparking discussions about socioeconomic privilege in higher education.\n\n2. **Findings from the Opportunity Insights Paper**\n\n   - The paper confirms the presence of biases favoring the wealthy through factors such as:\n     - Legacy preferences\n     - Athlete recruiting\n     - Overvaluation of private school graduates' non-academic qualifications\n   - Despite these biases, the researchers find that the causal impact of eliminating them would modestly change the distribution of Ivy+ students.\n\n3. **Key Arguments and Insights**\n\n   - The paper suggests that rich kids' dominance in Ivy+ schools is largely due to higher test scores, not just admissions bias.\n   - Proposal for a more egalitarian admissions process, though it alone isn't sufficient to drastically reshape student demographics.\n   - High SAT scores predict positive life outcomes, with smarter individuals more likely to succeed.\n\n4. **Selection vs. Causal Influences**\n\n   - A classic study by Dale and Krueger shows that while selective college grads earn more, this outcome is mostly due to selection effects rather than education or networking provided by the institutions.\n   - For certain groups (e.g., Black, Hispanic, or less-educated families), attending selective colleges does have significant positive effects on outcomes.\n\n5. **Recommendations for Reform**\n\n   - Suggests redirecting donations from billionaires to institutions like MIT and Chicago for their unbiased admissions policies.\n   - Encourages increases in undergraduate class sizes at elite schools to improve social mobility.\n   - Advocates for investment in flagship state universities and public colleges that effectively serve diverse, often immigrant-heavy communities.\n\n6. **Conclusion: Broader Implications**\n\n   - Emphasizes that Ivy+ schools alone won't drive social mobility; fundamental educational reforms are needed.\n   - Highlights the importance of improving public education quality, especially for poor kids who lack access to high-quality K-12 schooling, as a critical step toward addressing educational inequities.\n   - The focus should be on broader educational reforms rather than just on Ivy League admissions debates."},{id:0x8139d1e,title:'Europe\'s "law and order" urbanism ',subtitle:"Stricter gun laws and stricter enforcement ",date:"2023-08-01",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/europes-law-and-order-urbanism",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2253,comment_count:542,likes:248,category:"Tourism and Housing Dynamics in Urban Landscapes",summary:"1. **Introduction: Urbanism and City Preferences**\n\n   -

Missteps in Economic and Social Policies\n\n   - The *ownership society* faced setbacks such as failed Social Security privatization and relaxed bank supervision.\n   - These policies led to broader economic failures, compounded by continuous war spending.\n   - PEPFAR and early support for the *fracking revolution* are noted successful initiatives.\n\n6. Current Conservative Policy Proposals\n\n   - *National Conservative manifesto* contains underdeveloped ideas.\n     - Example: A proposed import tax aiming to address trade imbalance misaligns with practical concerns.\n     - Critiques highlight weaknesses in economic understanding and policy detail.\n\n7. Challenges on Right-wing Policy Development\n\n   - Education polarization limits the ability of the right to technically develop robust ideas.\n   - Conservatives desire sweeping societal changes but lack scalable policy solutions.\n   - Emphasis on small-scale, tactical political messages, such as critiques on Democratic stances regarding crime and immigration, resonate more than larger-scale transformations.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\n   - The Bush administration's mixed results underscore the importance of moving beyond high-level ideas to effective implementation.\n   - While the left has its share of challenges, the right struggles with educational polarization and clear, large-scale objectives.\n   - Conservatives need to align their large-scale societal change goals with actionable policies for real impact."},{id:0x81a2ae0,title:"Democrats need Marie Gluesenkamp Perez",subtitle:"An abortion rights defender well-suited to a rural working class district",date:"2023-08-15",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/democrats-need-marie-gluesenkamp",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2221,comment_count:374,likes:288,category:"Strategies and Challenges in Modern Politics",summary:"1.

The ERCTC was a temporary initiative aimed at addressing child poverty and welfare reform in the United States.\n     - Despite its potential, it lasted only one year and contributed to inflation before expiring.\n     - The hope was to create a durable program with wide-reaching benefits, but it failed to gain the necessary political traction.\n   - The failure is attributed to a lack of prioritization and understanding of program durability.\n     - Democrats spent significantly without establishing a lasting program.\n\n2. **Understanding Program Durability**\n\n   - Historically, programs like Medicaid and SNAP have proven durable.\n     - Medicaid expanded over time through various administrations.\n     - SNAP was expanded under multiple presidents, indicating a pattern of growing means-tested programs.\n   - The idea that effective social programs are self-sustaining is questioned.\n     - Programs need to be permanent to resist repeal, unlike the temporary ERCTC.\n\n3. **Political Challenges and Strategies**\n\n   - Political dynamics played a crucial role in the ERCTC's implementation and expiration.\n     - There was an absence of a unanimous agreement among Democrats on prioritizing the ERCTC.\n     - The initiative faced competition from other Democratic policy priorities, such as climate change and family benefits.\n   -

Current political science may overemphasize structural factors, ignoring the impact of choices and agency in politics.\n\n2. **Polarization and Political Choices**\n\n   - Polarization is both structural and influenced by political decisions.\n     - Cited example: Brendan Nyhan discusses Biden's polling influenced by polarization and economic perceptions.\n   - Politicians often make polarizing decisions when viewing polarization as inevitable.\n   - Media and academia emphasize polarization, affecting political decision-making.\n\n3. **Case Study: Donald Trump’s Influence**\n\n   - Trump’s 2016 moderate image quickly altered through his actions in office.\n     - Shift to the right contradicted campaign promises like protecting Medicaid and taxing the rich.\n   - Decisions like advocating for ACA repeal negatively impacted GOP in the 2018 midterms.\n\n4. **Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Campaign and Democratic Shifts**\n\n   - Clinton faced structural challenges in 2016, leading to strategic shifts to align with progressive voices.\n   - The Democratic Party has chosen to embrace left-wing economic policies post-Trump.\n     - Example: Biden’s administration worked with Warren supporters for legislative success.\n\n5. **Impacts of Strategic Political Moderation**\n\n   - Political moderation can reduce polarization but is often met with skepticism.\n   -

Introduction to Crime and Policing Debates\n\n   - The article discusses debates surrounding "broken windows policing."\n   - Two polarized views exist:\n     - Some believe it has conceptually solved urban crime.\n     - Others believe it is refuted by empirical evidence.\n   - *Key Argument*: The term "broken windows policing" lacks a clear definition and should focus on specific proposals.\n\n2. Origin and Evolution of Broken Windows Theory\n\n   - Originated from a 1982 Atlantic article by George Kelling and James Q. Wilson.\n   - Based on a 1969 experiment by Philip Zimbardo about *literal broken windows*.\n     - Experiment showed environmental cues can lead to increased crime and disorder.\n   - Initial intentions behind the theory:\n     - Presence of disorder signals tolerance for further disorder.\n\n3. Diverse Interpretations and Studies\n\n   - Confusion arises because the theory lacks a specific set of policies.\n   - *Different studies yield varied results*:\n     - **Hope Corman and Naci Mocan** found a correlation in NYC between misdemeanor arrests and reduced robberies/thefts.\n     - **Bernard Harcourt and Jens Ludwig** studied the Moving to Opportunity program, finding no causal link between orderly environments and reduced crime.\n     - **Jacinta Gau, Nicholas Corsaro, and Rod Brunson**, along with **Ren, Zhao, and He**, found disorder increases fear, affecting social cohesion and perceptions.\n     - **David Weisburd, et al.** found no significant impact from increased policing on crime perceptions or collective efficacy.\n   - *Conclusion*: There is a disorderly research landscape without consistent methodologies or conclusions.\n\n4. Ideological Debates and Misunderstandings\n\n   - The theory has been woven into political rhetoric, especially during Rudy Giuliani’s administration.\n   - Zimbardo intended to make a *left-wing* point, while it was interpreted as a right-wing approach for harsher policing.\n   - Harcourt and Ludwig aim to refute Kelling and Wilson, reminiscent of earlier conservative views on inherent criminal nature.\n\n5. Reinterpretations and New Findings\n\n   - Recent studies argue for non-policing methods like **cleaning vacant lots** as effective crime reduction strategies.\n   - Ideological bias may influence academic framing of results.\n   - When promoting policies such as vacant lot remediation, the *broken windows theory* can be referenced for bipartisan appeal.\n\n6. The Role of Policing and Policy Implications\n\n   - Two key beliefs associated with effective policing:\n     - **Policing over land use regulation** for neighborhood standards enforcement.\n     - *Deterring illegal concealed handgun carry* through strict policing of minor infractions.\n   - Private entities like malls use security for maintaining order, suggesting public spaces should similarly ensure orderliness.\n   - Avoids advocating for severe punishment, instead supports checking minor infractions for potential firearm violations.\n\n7. Conclusion on Disorder and Crime Management\n\n   - The article concludes that discussions on "broken windows" are clouded by vague significance.\n   - Emphasizes practical policing strategies divergent from the original hypothesis but with similar conclusions.\n   - Argues for effective urban space management to balance civil liberties with safety needs.'},{id:0x82a7fe9,title:"Annual booster mailbag ",subtitle:"Reconcilable differences, free speech, and why politics should be more like sports",date:"2023-09-15",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/annual-booster-mailbag",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:4483,comment_count:406,likes:105,category:"Democratic Party and Electoral Dynamics",summary:"1.

Introduction to the "Deaths of Despair" Narrative\n\n   - Anne Case and Angus Deaton introduced a narrative linking declining American life expectancy to populist-right politics and social decay.\n   - Criticism highlights fundamental flaws in their statistical analysis and the vague construct of "despair."\n   - The notable rise in opioid overdoses, not deaths of despair, drives the increase, contrasting with European experiences due to different pharmaceutical laws.\n\n2. Origin and Flaws of the Case-Deaton Analysis\n\n   - Case and Deaton\'s 2015 paper highlighted increasing death rates among white, non-Hispanic middle-aged Americans due to drug overdoses, suicides, and liver diseases.\n     - Flawed correlation with economic insecurity: No similar increase in Europe, and the trend began before economic downturns.\n   - Critics, like Andrew Gelman, pointed out that age adjustments paint a less dramatic picture of death rate increases.\n\n3. Evolution and Continued Critique of the Narrative\n\n   - Post-2017, Case and Deaton’s arguments linked "despair" specifically to non-college whites yet failed to address initial criticisms.\n   - Charles Lehman contested the lack of consistent evidence for a unified despair epidemic across demographics and time series.\n\n4. Shifts in Case and Deaton\'s Recent Argument\n\n   - Recent works shift focus from race to educational divides, minimizing the original "despair" theme.\n   - Emphasize long-term mortality divergence, with education level affecting trends in cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overdoses.\n   - Caroline Hoxby and others highlight selection effects due to education changes in demographic groups over time.\n\n5. Geographic Variation in Life Expectancy and Policy Impact\n\n   - Differences in public health outcomes are influenced by state policies, as shown in analyses comparing regions like Ohio and nearby states.\n     - Republican states with less regulation often see worse health outcomes.\n\n6. Analysis of Diverse Health Trends in the U.S.\n\n   - Increases in opioid deaths linked to drug policy and fentanyl rise.\n   - Divergences in public health outcomes across states signify policy differences.\n   - Variances in COVID-19 death rates are influenced by vaccine uptake, reflecting political divides.\n\n7. Conclusion: Moving Beyond "Despair"\n\n   - The need to address public health as discrete policy challenges.\n   - Challenges include incentivizing vaccine uptake, reducing gun-related suicides, and political hurdles in raising alcohol taxes.\n   - Case and Deaton’s narrative misdirects focus from established health concerns like smoking or heroin use to a vague despair model.\n   - Emphasis on the political aspect, particularly Republicans\' stance on regulation.'},{id:0x835e335,title:"Democrats should talk more about healthcare",subtitle:"Biden is doing big things and has more good proposals",date:"2023-10-12",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/democrats-should-talk-more-about",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2594,comment_count:247,likes:174,category:"Exploring Welfare and Economic Policy Reforms",summary:"1. **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Healthcare Provisions**\n\n   -

Executive orders and immigration policy could enhance healthcare supply.\n   - Democrats have trusted healthcare platforms with moderate and progressive appeal.\n   - Key message is ensuring access to preventative and essential healthcare services.\n\n9. **Political Messaging and Future Focus**\n\n   - Democrats could emphasize their role in safeguarding healthcare access.\n     - Aligns with abortion rights and broader healthcare initiatives.\n   - Advocacy and strategic communication efforts could elevate healthcare issues in political discourse.\n\n10. **Conclusion**\n\n    - Healthcare should be a Republican focal point in political debates and elections.\n    - Promoting the message that Democrats ensure accessible healthcare for all can unify their coalition and secure voter support."},{id:0x836aed3,title:"Radicalization doesn't help anyone",subtitle:"Palestine and Israel both need better friends and more realistic aspirations",date:"2023-10-11",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/radicalization-doesnt-help-anyone",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2492,comment_count:0,likes:616,category:"Complexities of the Israel-Palestine Conflict",summary:"1.

Overview and Context\n\n   - Kamala Harris is the subject of two detailed profiles exploring her role as Vice President.\n   - Her position is notably sensitive given the unpopularity of both President Biden and herself, and Biden's age heightens scrutiny on her.\n   - Harris's challenges are framed as both typical for a Vice President and intensified by factors like potential sexism and racism.\n\n2. Common Pattern in VP Selections\n\n   - Historically, vice presidential picks are often made for immediate political reasons rather than long-term leadership potential.\n   - Many U.S. presidents were former vice presidents, indicating the role’s importance despite its perception as largely ceremonial.\n   - Joe Biden's choice for vice president mirrors past selections driven by temporary needs rather than future leadership capabilities.\n\n3. Detailed Analysis of Harris's Selection\n\n   - Joe Biden faced party pressure to select a Black woman, leading to Harris's nomination despite no concrete evidence it benefited his campaign.\n   - Harris was chosen because she was perceived as qualified and likely to generate enthusiasm, not evaluated for potential 2028 candidacy or presidential readiness.\n\n4. Historical Context of VP Choices\n\n   - Several historical VP selections have backfired post-election due to lack of alignment with presidential policies or unforeseen circumstances.\n   - These cases illustrate a frequent oversight of the vice presidency’s eventual impact on party leadership.\n\n5. Assessment of Harris's Impact\n\n   - Harris’s selection, while criticized, fits within the norm of prior VP choices and has strengths in alignment with Democratic mainstream values.\n   - Her perceived weaknesses paradoxically benefited Biden, as a stronger VP might have led to calls for Biden's replacement.\n\n6. Recommendations for Harris\n\n   - Harris has unique opportunities as a Black woman to make statements or take positions that could appeal to a broad base and solidify her leadership.\n   - Leveraging her identity intelligently could help her stand out and regain the reasons for her initial elevation.\n   - The challenge lies in her approach to showcasing political talent and engaging effectively with both the electorate and the Democratic base.\n\n7. Conclusion on Vice Presidential Selections\n\n   - Kamala Harris exemplifies broader issues with how VP choices are typically managed.\n   - While not without flaws, her selection reasons and paths for improvement highlight the complexities in nominating vice presidential candidates.\n   - Previous vice presidents have been chosen for worse reasons, presenting Harris with a unique chance to shape perceptions positively."},{id:0x8388726,title:"Taking retail theft seriously ",subtitle:"A mid-sized problem with some available solutions ",date:"2023-10-17",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/taking-retail-theft-seriously",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2071,comment_count:562,likes:257,category:"Policing and Justice System Dynamics",summary:"1. **Introduction and Observation**\n\n   -

Introduction to *The Two-Parent Privilege* by Melissa Kearney\n\n   - Kearney addresses the controversy surrounding her book, which argues that children from two-parent households fare better than those from single-parent households.\n     - The thesis is considered uncontroversial by some due to data supporting better outcomes in two-parent homes.\n   - Discussions around policy implications and societal norms are central to the book's dialog.\n\n2. Main Findings of the Book\n\n   - **Two-Parent vs Single-Parent Households**\n     - Children raised by two parents generally have better life outcomes than those raised by a single parent.\n     - There is a persistent gap in child outcomes even after controlling for family income.\n     - *Parenting time and emotional bandwidth* are greater in two-parent households, contributing to better child outcomes.\n\n   - **Role of Income**\n     - Two-parent households generally have higher median incomes, impacting the quality of life and opportunities for children.\n     - Kearney discusses that income is important but does not entirely account for the advantages seen in two-parent families.\n\n3. Policy Implications and Debates\n\n   - **Welfare State Analysis**\n     - Kearney challenges conservative critiques that welfare programs lead to increased single-parent households.\n     - She argues for enhanced support for low-income families rather than diminishing safety nets.\n     - The welfare state's capacity or failure to mitigate income disparities is a critical focus.\n\n   - **Economic and Social Factors**\n     - Marriageable male hypothesis: economic struggles for men without a college degree affect marriage rates.\n     - Social norms surrounding marriage and parenting have shifted, especially outside college-educated communities.\n\n4. Societal Norms and Cultural Messaging\n\n   - **Norms and Outcomes**\n     - The erosion of traditional marriage norms may contribute to household instability, affecting children's outcomes.\n     - Kearney suggests that restoring certain norms and providing relationship education could benefit children's well-being.\n\n   - **Media and Social Influence**\n     - Media representations shape public attitudes about family structures, potentially impacting real-life decisions.\n     - Celebrities and community leaders can play vital roles in shaping perceptions of family norms.\n\n5. Addressing the Challenge\n\n   - **Supporting Families and Reestablishing Norms**\n     - There is a need for more investment in family support programs, including addressing intimate partner violence and responsible fatherhood.\n     - Kearney emphasizes that non-college educated dads are valuable to their children beyond economic contribution.\n\n   - **Proposed Strategies**\n     - Increasing public commitment to strong family structures through policy and support.\n     - Viewing family structure as crucial in policy decisions to address class gaps in child outcomes.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\n   - Kearney's book encourages a nuanced discussion of family structure and its impact on social and economic inequalities.\n   - The goal is not to blame single parents but to understand how two-parent homes can be a crucial part of supporting children's success.\n   - The topic requires a combination of policy solutions and cultural shifts to enhance outcomes for children across diverse family structures."},{id:0x83a9d89,title:"Professional development mailbag",subtitle:"Salami, antisemitism, and a defense of endowments",date:"2023-10-20",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/professional-development-mailbag",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:3472,comment_count:489,likes:155,category:"Democratic Party and Electoral Dynamics",summary:"1.

Supporting a *two-state solution* for the Israel/Palestine conflict is often seen as unpopular or "cringe."\n   - Both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian political circles have divergent, often conflicting, expectations towards the two-state solution.\n     - Pro-Israel stance often dismisses the need for a two-state solution due to past rejections by Palestinians.\n     - Pro-Palestinian advocates often view the two-state solution as obsolete and instead promote ideas like a single democratic state.\n\n2. **Support for Two-State Solution**\n\n   - Despite divisive politics, several influential figures and entities support the two-state solution:\n     - Mansour Abbas and the Ra’am political party in Israel.\n     - Governments of Egypt, Jordan, and the Gulf allies, as well as the Palestinian Authority and leader Marwan Barghouti.\n     - Supported by the United Nations and theoretically by figures like Joe Biden, though the commitment is criticized for lack of practical enforcement.\n\n3. **The Palestinian Perspective**\n\n   - Many young, left-leaning individuals sympathize with Palestinian civilians and the need for their better treatment.\n   - There\'s a narrative among activists promoting the view of Israel as a colonial entity, potentially overshadowing realistic solutions.\n   - Calls for supporting an independent Palestinian state are often drowned out by stronger demand for full "liberation."\n\n4. **Challenges in Advocacy and Misunderstandings**\n\n   - Israeli domestic politics and misconceptions complicate progress toward peace:\n     - Past opportunities for solutions were missed or mishandled, such as the Camp David and Annapolis talks.\n     - Security concerns and political reluctance within Israel have limited support for a two-state solution.\n   - Changes in regional geopolitics suggest a Republic of Palestine could be a stabilizing, rather than threatening, presence.\n\n5. **Two-State Solution vs. Alternative Proposals**\n\n   - Arguments against a two-state solution often cite impracticalities, but comprehensive solutions with clear logistics exist.\n   - The insistence on a bi-national state without practical detail fuels tension and lessens international support for Palestinian statehood.\n   - Effective advocacy requires a focused political agenda that balances fairness with realistic goals.\n\n6. **Conclusion and Path Forward**\n\n   - The article argues that pushing radical solutions over a two-state approach could undermine the Palestinian cause.\n   - Encourages focusing on achievable political solutions, like halting settlements and negotiating evacuations and land swaps.\n   - Emphasizes listening to key stakeholders (like the PA and regional Arab leaders) who continually support a moderated stance.\n   - The road to a peaceful resolution requires coherent, fair-minded diplomacy appealing to international allies.'},{id:0x8525819,title:"Another brutal year for the media industry ",subtitle:"Bleak fundamentals and the need for a business model ",date:"2023-12-12",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/another-brutal-year-for-the-media",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2583,comment_count:408,likes:228,category:"Competition, Media, and Future Risks",summary:"1. **Challenges in the Media Industry**\n\n   -

Others like Cond\xe9 Nast and NPR also implemented job cuts.\n   - These financial difficulties highlight systematic issues beyond just bad management.\n   - **Core Issue**: Increased competition due to the internet, not necessarily ideological misalignment.\n\n2. **Business Models in Media**\n\n   - **Key Considerations for Sustainability**:\n     - Traditional revenue streams like classified ads have disappeared, pushing media to adapt to new forms of competition.\n     - Journalism must contend with high-performing digital ad platforms and diverse content attractions.\n   - **The Role of Wealthy Patrons**:\n     - Models like Jeff Bezos covering losses at the Washington Post can sustain operations temporarily but lack long-term viability without a solid business plan.\n   - Importance of aligning journalistic endeavors with financially viable business models.\n\n3. **Local vs. National Media Coverage**\n\n   - Bezos's ambition shifted the Washington Post from local to global, resulting in:\n     - Decline in local news coverage, deteriorating public understanding of regional issues.\n     - Increased competition with leading national publications like the New York Times.\n   - A growing demand for detailed local journalism as audiences seek stories that affect their immediate community.\n\n4. **Structural Changes and Audience Demand**\n\n   - The competition drives media to become more opinionated, reflecting market demands rather than just factual reportage.\n   - Many consumers desire less biased reporting; however, nationalized markets favor niche appeal over broad neutrality.\n   - Reverting to less opinionated local journalism could satisfy unmet demands and avoid alienating audiences.\n\n5. **Internal Conflicts and Media Strategy**\n\n   - Media professionals often resist business-driven decisions, affecting content alignment with potential revenue strategies.\n   -

Introduction\n\n   - The author recounts an extensive reading journey in 2023, primarily focusing on works by Michael Connelly.\n   - Triggered by a renewed interest through adaptations like the \"Lincoln Lawyer\" series on Netflix, which led to exploring various Connelly series.\n\n2. Exploring Connelly's Works\n\n   - Started with the \"Harry Bosch\" series and continued through the \"Lincoln Lawyer\" and \"Renee Ballard\" series.\n   - Observations on the decades-long evolution of societal attitudes towards crime and policing mirrored in the books.\n   - Noted the significant changes in the character of Harry Bosch over time, reflecting societal shifts rather than individual character development.\n\n3. Changes in Harry Bosch's Character\n\n   - Initially right-wing, Bosch later displays liberal tendencies, such as anti-Trump sentiments in modern narratives.\n   - The critique is that Bosch's transition lacks psychological exploration and appears more reflective of author Michael Connelly's personal evolution.\n\n4. Bill Bratton's Influence\n\n   - Bratton, former LAPD Chief, features in several Bosch novels, embodying the law enforcement consensus of the early 2000s.\n   - His real-life successes influenced his portrayal, although the novels don't delve deeply into his crime-fighting philosophies.\n\n5. Punishment and Crime Control Philosophies\n\n   - Discussion of the three motives: incapacitation, deterrence, and retribution, focusing on the latter as Bosch's driving force.\n   - **Retribution vs. Crime Control**: Bosch represents retribution, while Bratton embodies crime control focused on incapacitation and deterrence.\n   - Bratton's practical policing strategies contrast with the fictional narrative's focus on detective work.\n\n6. The Role of Detective Work in Fiction\n\n   - Fictional depictions like Connelly's emphasize detective work rather than routine police activities, affecting public perception of policing efficacy.\n   - Bosch is successful due to his intensive, obsessive work ethic rather than brilliance or high-tech resources.\n   - This approach to solving crime is supported by research, indicating greater effort could improve resolution rates of cases, such as shootings.\n\n7. Conclusion and Implications\n\n   - The narrative presents an insight into underinvestment in both patrol and investigation aspects of policing in high-crime cities.\n   - Suggests a potential for a synergistic approach where effective prevention allows resources to be reallocated to more thorough investigations.\n   - Links the detailed, persistent detective work seen in Connelly's novels to broader opportunities for improving real-world crime-solving rates."},{id:0x853a41b,title:"Is it time for a second look at Kamala Harris?",subtitle:"With Biden's polling worse than ever, the Kamala question deserves a serious answer.",date:"2023-12-14",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/is-it-time-for-a-second-look-at-kamala",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2040,comment_count:423,likes:105,category:"Kamala Harris and Biden's Political Strategy",summary:'1. **Context and Current Dynamics**\n\n   -

**Comparison with Other Political Systems**\n     - Example of Germany potentially swapping unpopular leaders, unlike the U.S.\n\n2. **Kamala Harris\' Potential**\n\n   - **Perceptions and Polls**\n     - RCP averages show Trump marginally beating Biden and notably ahead of Harris.\n     - Biden and Harris have similar job approval ratings now, despite previous disparities.\n     - Some polling indicates Biden as the stronger candidate, but data is outdated and scarce.\n\n   - **Evaluating Harris**\n     - Harris\' past "Smart on Crime" stance might be favorable today.\n     - Recent decreases in crime, including murder rates, could play to her strengths.\n     - Her past concerns about school truancy align with current national issues.\n\n3. **Political Strategy and Message Framing**\n\n   - **Message Adaptation**\n     - Use of older Democratic messaging strategies, like "safe, legal, and rare" for abortion could resonate.\n     - Potential to harness enthusiasm for breaking the glass ceiling without making it her central message.\n\n   - **Opportunities for Growth**\n     - Harris has potential for improvement with a shift in political context favoring her past moderate positions.\n\n4. **Risks and Challenges for Biden**\n\n   - **Age and Health Concerns**\n     - Age is seen as a political liability for Biden, even if it does not directly cause policy failures.\n     - His age may impact campaign dynamics and public perception negatively.\n\n   - **Unknowns and Downside Risks**\n     - Biden’s health and family issues could pose risks during the campaign cycle.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Strategic Considerations**\n\n   - **Need for Reevaluation**\n     - Despite Harris not gaining popularity, she no longer lags behind Biden.\n     - More head-to-head polling is necessary to assess the best candidate against Trump.\n     - It might be strategic to consider a potential transition if it benefits the overarching goal of defeating Trump.'},{id:0x853bc04,title:"“Expedited removal” won’t fix asylum ",subtitle:"But it could open the door for unrelated bad Trump stuff in the future ",date:"2023-12-13",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/expedited-removal-wont-fix-asylum",authors:"Dara Lind",word_count:2177,comment_count:340,likes:132,category:"Legislative Strategies and Challenges",summary:'1. **Overview of Negotiations and Proposals**\n\n   -

Democrats may need to make concessions for Republican support.\n   - A possible point of agreement: Expanding "expedited removal" processes.\n\n2. **Understanding Expedited Removal**\n   \n   - Expedited removal can bypass procedural checks required in standard deportation proceedings.\n     - Typically used for quick deportation without court hearings.\n   - Statutory authority exists for broader application, although historically, it\'s used near borders or shortly after entry.\n   - Expansion implications:\n     - Would mainly affect long-term unauthorized residents.\n     - **Potential to facilitate mass deportations** under future administrations.\n\n3. **Legal and Humanitarian Considerations**\n   \n   - The current process involves "credible fear" interviews to protect individuals from unfair deportation.\n     - This standard is seen as a weakness by critics due to high passage rates.\n   - Discussions suggest raising this to a "reasonable fear" standard to potentially reduce asylum claims.\n   - Capacity challenges:\n     - Need for asylum officers and facilities to manage increased expedited removals.\n     - Existing legal frameworks, like the *Flores Agreement*, limit detention capacities.\n\n4. **Political and Practical Challenges**\n   \n   - Expanding expedited removal alone may not solve current asylum backlogs or border security issues.\n     - Overflow issues stem from existing infrastructure limitations.\n   - Congressional action would be needed for significant changes, potentially requiring substantial financial investment.\n   - Long-term residents might face increased risk under new regulations, impacting community stability.\n\n5. **Potential for Future Policy Shifts**\n   \n   - Current administration shows little interest in large-scale deportations.\n   - Future administrations could leverage expanded expedited removal for broader deportation efforts.\n   - **Statutory obstacles removed could reduce congressional resistance** to enforcing mass deportations.\n\n6. **Conclusion and Key Takeaways**\n\n   - Expanding expedited removal is a controversial strategy with limited immediate impact on border security.\n   - The approach could serve a future deporter-in-chief\'s agenda more than today\'s challenges.\n   - Fundamental problems persist due to insufficient infrastructure and legal protections, necessitating thoughtful resource allocation.\n   - While policymakers seek quick fixes, historical trends show these solutions often lead to temporary successes and long-term challenges.'},{id:0x85423fa,title:"Midwinter mailbag ",subtitle:"Taylor Swift's categorical imperative and what's up with the $400?",date:"2023-12-16",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/midwinter-mailbag",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:3859,comment_count:258,likes:105,category:"Democratic Party and Electoral Dynamics",summary:"1.

The phrase \"the public library is not that punk\" is highlighted by the popularity of t-shirts supporting the DC Punk Archive.\n   - *Key Concept*: Although the archive features valuable historical punk items, the library contrasts the punk ethos with its quiet, orderly environment.\n\n2. **Contrasts between Punk and Public Institutions**\n\n   - Public libraries are seen as orderly and reverent spaces preserving the past, unlike punk's chaotic nature.\n   - Ironically, former punk enthusiasts now support the libraries they once might have rejected.\n   - *Crucial Point*: The library represents an anti-capitalist alternative that aligns with progressive politics versus punk's chaotic rebellion.\n\n3. **Historical Context of Socialism vs. Anarchism**\n\n   - Socialism historically promoted public ownership, contrary to anarchist views on property legality.\n   - In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, anarchists used extreme actions, while Marxism grew in prominence.\n   -

Punk's appeal lies in its individualistic rebellion, but significant societal contributions come from building and managing public institutions.\n   - Being part of mainstream governance involves handling challenging trade-offs and enforcing rules.\n   - The evolution from rebellious punk youth to civic-minded adults reflects the transition from individualism to community responsibility.\n   - *Final Thought*: Ultimately, those who wish to make a real impact will find themselves needing to embrace authority and structure, like a librarian shushing patrons."},{id:0x87046b2,title:"We need to see more Joe Biden",subtitle:"And he needs an administration that believes in Bidenism",date:"2024-02-13",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/we-need-to-see-more-joe-biden",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2041,comment_count:452,likes:287,category:"Kamala Harris and Biden's Political Strategy",summary:"1. **Biden's Age and Public Perception**\n\n   -

Data centers require significant electricity usage to avoid outages.\n     - Backup generators, often using diesel, are a common solution, similar to hospitals.\n     - Data center construction is increasing more than hospitals.\n   - Governor Wes Moore of Maryland supports legislation to streamline permitting for high-energy facilities, aiming to boost Maryland’s economy with data centers.\n     - This has drawn criticism from environmental groups due to concerns over state greenhouse gas emission targets.\n\n2. **Environmental Groups' Concerns**\n\n   - The focus is on the strain data centers place on Maryland's energy grid, impacting climate targets.\n     - **Key Point**: Shifting the location of data centers doesn't affect global climate change.\n   - Achieving state emissions targets is easier without data centers, yet this does not impact global CO2 concentrations.\n\n3. **The Argument Against State-Level Emissions Targets**\n\n   - Critique: State-level emissions targets are not effectively designed.\n     - Some states like Maryland are progressive but need strategies that make sense on a broader scale.\n   - State policy can influence the national energy mix but focusing narrowly on state emissions may be counterproductive.\n   - Example: New York's slow population growth helps keep emissions low, but such localized efforts don't aid in broader emission reductions.\n\n4. **State Policy and Its Impact on Climate**\n\n   - Maryland’s initiatives in wind and solar energy illustrate impactful actions beyond emissions targets.\n     - **Case Study**: Maryland's efforts to boost offshore wind production and solar farm projects.\n   - The notion of geographic emissions targets conflicts with economic growth strategies.\n     - The importance of considering emissions in a national context rather than localized geography.\n\n5. **Broader Implications and Recommendations**\n\n   - Environmental groups may oppose data centers due to high electricity demands, but degrowth is not a widely supported agenda.\n     - **Contradiction**: Progressive policies need to integrate growth-friendly approaches.\n   - State-level targets can be harmful, as they incentivize minimizing in-state activity rather than tangible climate benefits.\n   - A focus on policies that foster economic growth while reducing emissions is recommended.\n\n6. **Conclusion and Future Considerations**\n\n   - The relevance of state policies in climate action remains critical.\n     - Successful models incorporate energy policies that transcend local emissions targets.\n   - States like New York and Maryland exemplify opportunities and challenges in aligning state policy with national climate goals.\n     -

The series explores themes of life after an *apocalyptic nuclear war*.\n   - The films highlight Australia's relative sparing from nuclear devastation but suffering from the *collapse of the global economy*.\n   - The original \"Mad Max\" focused on *resource scarcity* as a precursor to societal collapse, exemplified by oil shortages.\n\n2. **Themes and Allegories**\n\n   - George Miller's films can be seen as *climate change allegories*.\n   - The narrative shifts from fearing oil scarcity to concerns about *overusing oil* and its environmental impacts.\n   - The audience's perception of environmental issues has evolved since the 1979 original film.\n\n3. **Nuclear War and Its Implications**\n\n   - Nuclear war in the series emphasizes *ecological disaster* rather than complete extinction.\n   - Experts like James Scouras suggest that beyond immediate casualties, the *environmental aftermath* would cause widespread issues, like global cooling from *nuclear winter*.\n\n4. **Resource Scarcity and Historical Context**\n\n   - Historical events like the Persian Gulf War demonstrate that resource competition, especially oil, can lead to conflict, though scarcity itself wasn’t always the direct cause.\n   - Recent incidents, such as Venezuela's territorial claims over Guyana's oil-rich areas, reflect *tensions heightened by resource abundance*, not scarcity.\n\n5. **Modern Context and Electric Vehicles**\n\n   -

Osteopathic doctors (DOs) offer a *holistic treatment approach* emphasizing preventive care, the musculoskeletal system, and the overall "mind, body, and spirit" of the patient.\n   - Despite its origins being ostracized, DOs now have equal training and practice rights alongside medical doctors (MDs).\n\n2. **Historical Context and Evolution**\n\n   - **Origin:** Founded by Dr. Andrew Taylor Still, who aimed to treat the root causes of illness rather than symptoms.\n     - Emphasized understanding the “mind, body, and spirit”.\n     - Introduced Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT).\n   - **Challenges:** Initially faced backlash as a “cult” and had lower standards compared to medical schools.\n   - **Adaptation:** Integrated mainstream medical practices, aligning standards with MDs.\n     - By 1960s began receiving certifications equivalent to MDs.\n     - Now integrated into the singular accreditation system for residency programs.\n\n3. **Contemporary Relevance and Challenges**\n\n   - DOs make up 11% of all physicians in the U.S. and 25% of current medical students.\n   - **Field Application:**\n     - Less likely to prescribe opioids, beneficial amid the opioid crisis.\n     - Effective use of OMT for chronic pain conditions like back pain and migraines.\n   - **Bias:** Persistent bias in residency programs, with some requiring DO students to take dual licensing exams.\n\n4. **Public Health Impact**\n\n   - Addresses key public health issues: Opioid Epidemic, chronic pain treatment.\n   - Demonstrated potential in managing hypertension and heart disease.\n   - Especially prominent in offering primary care and serving rural, underserved areas.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Imperative Awareness**\n\n   - DOs play a crucial role in bridging gaps in healthcare, particularly primary care, expected to face significant shortages.\n   - Awareness need: A significant number of Americans remain unfamiliar with DOs and their effectiveness.\n   -

Erroneous Beliefs vs. Elite Misinformation\n\n   - **Erroneous Beliefs**: Many incorrect beliefs are not misinformation but simply misunderstood or underreported facts.\n     - Example: The U.S. government’s belief in a non-existent Iraqi nuclear program influenced politics and media.\n   - **Elite Misinformation**: Mainstream institutions often spread misleading information, termed as "elite misinformation."\n     - Case Study: The rise in U.S. maternal mortality was exaggerated due to changes in counting methods, creating confusion.\n\n3.

Catastrophism in Information\n\n   - **Exaggerated Crises**: Predicted disasters from policies like childcare subsidy expiration or net neutrality were overstated.\n     - Real-world outcomes were less severe than foretold.\n   - **Republican Misinformation**: Claims that tax cuts will self-fund mirror exaggerations made by Democrats.\n\n5. Impact of Misleading Rhetoric\n\n   - **Influencing Supporters vs. Opponents**: Misleading narratives often affect engaged supporters rather than persuading skeptics or opponents.\n     - Example: Misleading information about child care or fossil fuel subsidies confuses allies more than persuading neutral parties.\n   - **Consequences of Bad Information**: Sustained reforms require genuine solutions, not misleading narratives.\n     - Effective policy change needs accurate data and sound proposals, not false urgency.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\n   - The use of misinformation, whether intentional or not, compromises the effectiveness of policy advocacy.\n     - Lasting reforms are built on truth and precise understanding of issues, not manipulated perceptions.\n     - **Key Insight**: Emphasizing real problems and pragmatic solutions can foster genuine progress in complex issues like climate change or public health.'},{id:0x8b344e6,title:"The NBA has an audience problem",subtitle:"The league's historic TV deal masks poor fundamentals",date:"2024-06-29",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-nba-has-an-audience-problem",authors:"Ben Krauss",word_count:1497,comment_count:258,likes:123,category:"Challenges and Innovations in Sports and Gambling",summary:"1. **Current Success and Challenges of the NBA**\n\n   - The NBA is on the verge of signing a historic TV deal, increasing its broadcasting fees significantly.\n     - New teams are expected to launch in Seattle and Las Vegas.\n     - The NBA is the leading American sports export globally.\n   - Despite financial success, the league is facing declining regular season ratings.\n     - Ratings for the most recent NBA Finals dropped by 12%.\n     - Viewership for regular season games has been stagnant or declining.\n\n2. **Reasons for Declining Viewership**\n\n   - Structural changes in how audiences consume media.\n     - Roughly 50% of households have transitioned from cable to streaming services.\n     - Casual fans have more entertainment options leading to competition for attention.\n   - Despite decline, the NBA’s ratings haven’t completely plummeted relative to other entertainment options.\n     - The NBA still sees a significant viewership spike during the postseason.\n\n3. **Negotiating a New TV Deal**\n\n   - Networks are investing to avoid losing NBA content to competitors.\n     - The league’s existing audience base is considered valuable despite the drop in ratings.\n   - Broader entertainment industries also face declining ratings, making the NBA an attractive offering in comparison.\n\n4. **Future Risks and Recommendations for Improvement**\n\n   - There’s a risk of complacency leading to further decline in viewership.\n     - The NBA needs to prioritize audience engagement, particularly during the regular season.\n   - Potential strategies for increasing regular season popularity:\n     - Reduce the total number of games to mirror the NFL’s limited schedule.\n     - Enhance the in-season tournament to carry playoff implications.\n     - Consider innovative rule changes and experimental formats.\n       - Move back the three-point line.\n       - Eliminate intentional fouls to quicken the game pace.\n       - Implement a target score for dynamic game conclusions.\n   \n5. **Conclusion: The Need for Innovation**\n\n   - The NBA should consider bold reforms to maintain its cultural relevance.\n     - Many ideas exist but hesitancy to change could hinder long-term growth.\n   - Success relies on engaging both diehard and casual fans through strategic innovative changes, maintaining popularity for future decades."},{id:0x8b36e1b,title:"China is huge, not rich",subtitle:"Some people say we need one billion Americans",date:"2024-06-27",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/china-is-huge-not-rich",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:1859,comment_count:437,likes:214,category:"Evolving Strategies in US-China Relations",summary:"1.

Analyzed consumer credit data of 7 million individuals.\n        - Found significant negative financial impacts in states with legal sports gambling:\n          - Average credit scores fell by 1%.\n          - Bankruptcy filings increased by 25-30%.\n          - Collections on unpaid debts rose by 8%.\n        - Young men in low-income areas experienced acute financial distress.\n\n     2. *“Gambling Away Stability: Sports Betting’s Impact on Vulnerable Households”*\n\n        - Analyzed data from over 230,000 households.\n        - Found increased betting without reducing other gambling activities.\n        - Investments in the stock market were negatively impacted.\n        - Low-income households spent disproportionately more on gambling, leading to higher credit card balances and debt.\n\n3. **Industry Response and Concerns**\n\n   - Major gambling websites launched initiatives for “responsible betting.”\n   - The business model relies on frequent and high-value bets from a small percentage of users.\n   - Industry lobbying efforts continue to expand gambling legalization across more states.\n\n4. **Legislative and Policy Response**\n\n   - The path to broader legalization faces challenges, as seen in states like California and Texas.\n   - Internet gambling (“iGaming”) is emerging as a significant area of interest for the industry.\n   -

Climate change is largely an issue of *global coordination*.\n   - Attempts to address it often overlook international complexities.\n   - Misunderstandings lead to misplaced priorities and confusion.\n\n2. **National vs. Global Emissions**\n\n   - The U.S. has decreased its CO2 emissions since 1990.\n     - Global emissions have increased, due to economic growth in countries like China and India.\n   - Climate change differs from conventional pollution as it requires global cooperation, beyond local political actions.\n   \n3. **Challenges of Decarbonization**\n\n   - U.S. climate legislation, such as the IRA, has a limited global impact because:\n     - **U.S. contributes a modest share of global emissions**.\n     - Benefits of U.S. emissions reductions largely accrue to foreign countries.\n   - Decarbonization efforts can be likened to *foreign aid*, rather than benefiting the implementing country alone.\n\n4. **Economic Implications and Global Aid**\n\n   - Mitigation costs primarily benefit other countries due to interconnected climate effects.\n   - Investing in direct foreign aid may offer a better cost-benefit outcome compared to some climate initiatives.\n   - Example: $5,000 in anti-malarial aid versus the same amount in climate mitigation.\n\n5. **Political and Practical Considerations**\n\n   - Political mechanisms are naturally biased towards local benefits.\n   - Global agreements for climate action remain challenging and often unachievable.\n   - Efforts should focus on economically beneficial emission reductions and technical advancements.\n\n6. **Proposed Alternatives**\n\n   - Suggestions include "Green Deregulation" and policies that do not heavily tax the economy.\n     - Examples: Nuclear energy support, geothermal drilling, and Class VI wells.\n   - Critique of misleading strategies, such as declaring a "climate emergency," which may confuse policy intent.\n\n7. **Conclusion**\n\n   - Recognize that some global challenges are inherently difficult.\n   - Prioritize pragmatic and economically sound solutions.\n   - Focus on achievable international aid efforts while encouraging technical and economic growth-oriented climate actions.'},{id:0x8cb7809,title:"Politicians should talk to the press more ",subtitle:"And reporters should ask better questions ",date:"2024-08-13",audience:"everyone",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/politicians-should-talk-to-the-press",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2152,comment_count:330,likes:226,category:"Future Democratic Strategies for 2024",summary:"1.

Barack Obama's call for housing reform at the Democratic Convention was impactful for two main reasons:\n     - The endorsement was directly from Obama, highlighting the importance of housing reform.\n     - It was unexpected, shifting the focus of the convention to housing issues.\n   - This endorsement cast Kamala Harris's own housing commitments in a more YIMBY (Yes In My Backyard) light.\n\n2. **Kamala Harris's Economic Policy and Profile**\n\n   - Harris has had limited involvement in economic policy before her vice presidency.\n   - Different political camps are attempting to shape her profile.\n   - Rising housing costs are becoming a prominent issue, moving from niche to mainstream discourse.\n\n3. **Implications of Housing's Political Prominence**\n\n   - Increased attention aids advocacy and funding but also risks uninformed policy propositions gaining traction.\n   - Historical bipartisan progress in housing reform has been made through low-profile strategies.\n   - Prominent figures like Obama are crucial in guiding productive housing discussions.\n\n4. **Federal Housing Policies and Proposals**\n\n   - The Obama administration previously emphasized regulatory constraints to housing, releasing a housing development toolkit.\n   - The Trump administration initially agreed with YIMBY analyses but lacked follow-through.\n   - Key proposals like the HOME Act aimed to link federal funding with housing reforms, gaining mixed political reactions.\n   - Biden administration's efforts included endorsements and small executive actions for housing supply.\n\n5. **Challenges and Future Directions**\n\n   - State-level YIMBY actions face challenges such as local resistance and economic conditions like high-interest rates.\n   - Congressional leadership could benefit from a revival of initiatives like the HOME Act.\n   - Cooperation between deregulation-supporting Republicans and federal involvement skeptics is essential.\n\n6. **Policy Innovations and Proposals**\n\n   - Pro-supply policies should extend beyond zoning reforms to areas like transportation and water grants.\n   - Harris should focus on maximizing the efficacy of supply-side spending measures.\n   - Suggested reforms include clarifying mortgage regulations to facilitate access to starter homes.\n\n7. **Fiscal and Thought Leadership Considerations**\n\n   - Fiscal policies, like tax reform impacting mortgage rates, indirectly affect housing supply.\n   - Obama's message advocates reducing outdated regulations rather than broad government interventions.\n   - Thoughtful political leadership can reshape perceptions and approaches to housing policy.\n\n8. **Local Involvement and National Framing**\n\n   - Engaging in local housing issues, like New York’s “City of Yes” proposal or San Francisco races, can set positive precedents.\n   - National framing of housing abundance as governance reform in Democratic cities can align with broader policy objectives.\n   - This dual approach supports both economic reasoning and appeals to density, aligning with Harris's electoral needs."},{id:0x8d4481b,title:"Voters care about issues, even lobstermen",subtitle:"Just because you don’t care doesn’t mean nobody does ",date:"2024-08-28",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/voters-care-about-issues-even-lobstermen",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2443,comment_count:361,likes:199,category:"Complexities and Debates in Climate Policy",summary:"1. **Introduction**\n\n   -

The conversation around federal-level housing reform has stalled.\n     - *Federal transportation dollars* tied to land use reforms is a proposed solution.\n     - Ed Glaeser and others have suggested this before; it was part of previous political discussions and bills.\n   - Political resistance exists among both Democrats and Republicans.\n     - Suburban Democrats oppose it due to local impacts.\n     - Republicans, like Senator Todd Young, favor non-interference from the federal government.\n   - The Trump administration took notice but responded negatively, associating reforms with detrimental suburban impacts.\n\n2. **Local Housing Supply Solutions**\n\n   - DC's strict building height regulations under the *Height of Buildings Acts* of 1899 and 1910 limit housing development.\n     - Comparatively, cities like Billings, MT, and Charlotte, NC have much taller buildings.\n   - The case for reevaluating these height restrictions is supported by urban transit needs and commercial real estate trends.\n     - Strong transit hubs in DC are underutilized due to these limits.\n     - COVID-19 and remote work have decreased office space demand, creating opportunities for residential conversions.\n\n3. **Office-to-Residential Conversions**\n\n   - Converting office spaces to residential units faces economic and structural challenges.\n     - Offices are not inherently suited for conversion due to design constraints.\n     - Sometimes complete teardown and rebuilding is more practical.\n   - Proposals to make conversions more feasible include:\n     - Allowing experimental floor plans.\n     - Facilitating the replacement cycle by permitting taller structures.\n\n4. **Leveraging Federal Control in DC**\n\n   - Congress can deregulate DC land use without federalism conflicts.\n     - This involves relaxing the Height Act to encourage growth.\n   - Local zoning in DC is influenced by federal appointees.\n     - The federal government can appoint pro-housing figures.\n     - Many federally used lands could be repurposed post-Height Act reform.\n\n5. **Conclusion and National Implications**\n\n   - Repealing the Height Act is a targeted federal action supporting housing growth without breaching federalist principles.\n     - Appointment of pro-growth figures to zoning boards can facilitate changes.\n   - These changes could reposition DC's real estate market, addressing both the housing supply crisis and city revenue needs.\n   - Despite being a local initiative, it demonstrates federal action's potential in housing discussions—aligning with emerging political interests in national housing strategies."},{id:0x8dcaf80,title:"Prequels are bad ",subtitle:"A little pop culture complaining as a break from the election",date:"2024-09-16",audience:"only_paid",canonical_url:"https://www.slowboring.com/p/prequels-are-bad",authors:"Matthew Yglesias",word_count:2143,comment_count:434,likes:141,category:"Competition, Media, and Future Risks",summary:'1. **Introduction to Prequels in Pop Culture**\n\n   -
